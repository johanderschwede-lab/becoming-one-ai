# AI Agent Enhancement Proposal

This document proposes implementing a new AI agent for community moderation.

## Key Features:
- Automated content filtering
- Sentiment analysis for community health
- Integration with existing moderation tools

## Priority: Medium
This would be a nice-to-have enhancement for community management.

## Implementation Notes:

- May need training data from existing moderation patterns
- Should be implemented after core features are stable
