# üìò INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_CURSOR

## üß† Objective
You are tasked with **intelligently ingesting, organizing, filtering, and evolving** a massive body of material submitted by Johan and Marianne ‚Äî the founders of the *Becoming One‚Ñ¢* project. The materials span prompts, strategy documents, integrations, system architecture, esoteric models, and raw drafts.

Your goal is to:
* Preserve what matters.
* Eliminate what doesn't.
* Transform the rest into a **clean, evolving Compass system** for real-world use by AI agents and human collaborators.

## ‚úÖ What to Import and Retain

### 1. ‚úÖ Real Content Prompts & Operational Material
* **Any file explicitly labeled with**: `prompt`, `agent`, `persona`, `system`, `execution`, `blueprint`, `strategy`, `integration`, `architecture`, `canvas`, `manifesto`, `roadmap`, or `plan`.
* Examples:
  * `Master Prompt Willbeone.docx`
  * `Becoming_One_Method_Integration.md`
  * `AI Coach Persona Prompt`
  * `Supabase Schema.sql`
  * `compare.py`, `upload.py`, `index.md`, `dashboard.py`

### 2. ‚úÖ Source-Worthy Concepts & Models
* Philosophical, methodological, or schematic source documents that form the backbone of the *Becoming One‚Ñ¢* method.
* Retain **model outlines**, **emotional digestion principles**, **Hylozoic integrations**, **Fourth Way connections**, and all files involving transformation, essence, evolution, resistance, or personal capacity.
* Examples:
  * `COMPREHENSIVE_CONSCIOUSNESS_MAPPING_SYSTEM.md`
  * `HYLOZOICS_INTEGRATION_TEMPLATE.md`
  * `FOURTH_WAY_INTEGRATION_TEMPLATE.md`

### 3. ‚úÖ Executional System Components
* Source files directly powering the Supabase, Cursor, or Telegram AI orchestration.
* All `.py`, `.md`, `.sql`, and `.yaml` configuration or logic files that reflect user-defined logic, not AI suggestions.

## üõë What to Ignore, Discard, or Quarantine

### 1. ‚ùå AI-Fluff, Hallucinated Structuring
* Any file that was overly verbose, circular, or **did not contain meaningful user-authored structure**.
* Often marked by:
  * Buzzword inflation (e.g., "Unified Consciousness Transformation Protocol")
  * Overuse of GPT-generated synonyms and bloated summaries
  * Content that repeats itself without adding layers of specificity
* Suggested action: **Quarantine into a `__trash_fluff_review` folder**, not deleted, for manual inspection.

### 2. ‚ùå Unreferenced Templates or Experimental Variants
* AI-generated variants with unclear purpose, often ending in `_v2`, `_v3`, `_refined`, etc.
* If not referenced in the Master Prompt, roadmap, or Supabase schema ‚Äî ignore.

## üìÅ Folder Structure
```plaintext
/CompassBuilder
  /Phase1_Legacy_Imports        ‚Üê Raw files (safe backup, not modified)
  /Phase2_Clean_Logic           ‚Üê Refactored YAMLs, Python, Prompts, Indexes
    /supabase_sync              ‚Üê upload.py, schema.sql
    /visual_index               ‚Üê dashboard.py, index.md, tag maps
    /versioning                 ‚Üê compare.py, diff_explainer.py
    /auto_ingest               ‚Üê ingestion automation (pipeline.py)

```

## üìä Version Control Guidelines
* Always save version diffs in `versioning/compare.py`
* Use GPT-powered diff summaries in `diff_explainer.py`
* Store all changes with `prompt_modules`, `prompt_versions` tables (via Supabase)
* Maintain change logs and human-readable summaries

## üß¨ Agent Persona & Behavior Requirements
Save agents only if they meet **all** the following:
* Clearly defined **role** and **scope**
* Explicit tone and escalation logic
* Mapped to user need (Amanita, Laurency, AI Coach, Telegram Funnel Guide, etc.)

Discard agents that:
* Feel shallow or overly generalized
* Are AI-invented without human validation

## üß† Learning from Past Mistakes
Avoid:
* Poor data retention
* Redundant output
* Unstructured prompt bloat
* AI hallucination contaminating real vision

## ‚úçÔ∏è Documentation Requirements
Every module must have:
* Autogenerated `README.md`
* Uses `module_template.md` with emoji support and summary structure
* Is logged in the visual index (with version, tags, links)

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal Requirements
* Include all legal files: `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`, `DISCLAIMER.md`, `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
* Do not rewrite, paraphrase, or embed these in any prompt unless explicitly instructed

## üß≠ Final Reminders
* Be rigorous. Don't assume ‚Äî verify.
* Structure like a builder, not a brainstormer.
* Preserve voice. Maintain system-level precision.
* Keep everything useful ‚Äî and nothing else.
