# ðŸš€ **RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**
## **Manual Deployment via Web Interface**

Since the Railway CLI is having issues with interactive prompts, here's how to deploy via the web interface:

---

## ðŸ“‹ **STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT**

### **1. Create New Railway Project**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
5. Select this repository: `johanniklasson/becoming-one-ai`
6. Name the project: **"becoming-one-ai"**

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
Add these environment variables in Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Core API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here

# Database
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here

# Vector Database
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment_here

# Optional: Payment System
TELEGRAM_PAYMENT_PROVIDER_TOKEN=your_payment_token_here

# Optional: Make.com Integration
MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL=your_make_webhook_url_here

# Model Configuration
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
```

### **3. Configure Deployment Settings**
- **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `python src/bots/telegram/enhanced_telegram_bot.py`
- **Port:** Railway will auto-detect (not needed for Telegram bot)

### **4. Deploy**
1. Click **"Deploy Now"**
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Check logs for any errors

---

## ðŸ”§ **FILES PREPARED FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **âœ… Configuration Files Created:**
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `Procfile` - Process definition for Railway
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (already exists)

### **âœ… Application Ready:**
- Enhanced Telegram bot with RBAC
- Authentic branding implemented
- Payment system integrated
- All dependencies properly configured

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

### **Immediate Results:**
- âœ… Bot runs 24/7 in the cloud
- âœ… Auto-scaling based on usage
- âœ… Professional monitoring
- âœ… Automatic restarts on errors

### **Next Steps After Deployment:**
1. Test bot functionality via Telegram
2. Verify RBAC and payment systems
3. Test personality analysis features
4. Monitor logs and performance

---

## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Build fails:** Check that all environment variables are set
2. **Bot doesn't respond:** Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
3. **Database errors:** Check Supabase credentials
4. **AI not working:** Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid

### **How to Check Logs:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Monitor for errors

---

## ðŸ’¡ **ALTERNATIVE: GitHub Integration**

If you prefer automated deployments:

1. **Push code to GitHub** (if not already there)
2. **Connect Railway to GitHub repo**
3. **Enable auto-deployments** on push to main branch
4. **Configure environment variables** as above

This way, every time you push changes to GitHub, Railway automatically redeploys!
