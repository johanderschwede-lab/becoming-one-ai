# 🗂️ Becoming One™ INBOX System

## Automated Content Curation & Processing

**The Problem You Solved**: "I want to drop content in a folder and have AI automatically organize it, separate Johan/Marianne teaching from participant feedback, upload to knowledge base, and generate content suggestions."

**The Solution**: A simple INBOX folder that watches, processes, and organizes everything automatically.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works (Simple Overview)**

```
1. Drop file in INBOX → 2. AI processes → 3. Content organized → 4. Knowledge base updated
```

**You do**: Drop any file in the INBOX folder  
**AI does**: Everything else automatically

---

## 📁 **Setup: Point to Your NAS Folder**

### **Step 1: Choose Your INBOX Location**
```bash
# Examples of INBOX folder locations:
/Volumes/NAS/BecomingOne/INBOX          # Mac NAS mount
\\NAS\BecomingOne\INBOX                 # Windows NAS mount  
~/Documents/BecomingOne/INBOX           # Local folder
/home/johan/shared/INBOX                # Linux shared folder
```

### **Step 2: Start the Processor**
```bash
# Basic usage
python start_inbox_processor.py /Volumes/NAS/BecomingOne/INBOX

# Process existing files first, then watch
python start_inbox_processor.py /Volumes/NAS/BecomingOne/INBOX --process-existing
```

### **Step 3: Drop Files and Watch the Magic**
The system automatically creates this structure:
```
INBOX/
├── [Drop files here] ← You drop files here
├── processing/       ← AI is working on these
├── completed/        ← Successfully processed
├── failed/          ← Need manual attention
├── teaching_materials/
├── community_content/  
├── content_suggestions/
└── logs/            ← Processing history
```
