## üó£Ô∏è **BRAND VOICE & TONE**

### **üìù COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES:**

#### **CLARITY OVER MYSTIQUE:**
```
Instead of: "Activate your divine light body through sacred geometry"
We say: "Notice what happens when you pay attention to your breathing"

Instead of: "Transmute your shadow through alchemical integration"
We say: "Feel the uncomfortable feeling completely until it changes"

We say: "Here's what we've noticed works - try it and see for yourself"

Instead of: "I channel divine wisdom for your awakening"
We say: "We're all figuring this out together - here's our experience"
