## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Database Schema**
```bash
# Connect to Supabase and run enhanced schema
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f database/schemas/enhanced_hylozoics_schema.sql
```

### **Step 2: Configure Pinecone Namespaces**
The enhanced library uses two Pinecone namespaces:
- `hylozoics_sacred`: For exact quote retrieval (sacred mode)
- `hylozoics_vector`: For AI synthesis and insights (vector mode)

### **Step 3: Add Multi-Language Sample Data**
```bash
# The enhanced schema includes sample multi-language quotes
# Additional quotes can be added via the enhanced library
```

### **Step 4: Integrate Enhanced Commands**
Update your main Telegram bot to include the enhanced commands:
```python
from src.bots.telegram.commands.enhanced_hylozoics_commands import enhanced_hylozoics_commands

# Add to your bot's command handlers
application.add_handler(CommandHandler("hylozoics", enhanced_hylozoics_commands.hylozoics_command))
```

### **Step 5: Test the Dual-Mode System**
```
/hylozoics
→ Select "Ask Question (Dual-Mode)"
→ Ask: "What is consciousness?"
→ Verify: Swedish original + English translation + AI insights
```
