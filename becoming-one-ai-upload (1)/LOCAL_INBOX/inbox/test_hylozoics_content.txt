# Hylozoics Development Example

**From Marianne**: I've been reflecting on the stages of human development, and I see how most of our clients are transitioning from civilization consciousness to culture consciousness. They're moving beyond just following social rules to discovering their individual path.

But what excites me is when someone makes the leap to humanity consciousness - when their motivation shifts from personal development to service. You can feel it in their presence, like they're accessing a different kingdom of consciousness entirely.

**From Johan**: Exactly. And this maps perfectly to what we see with anchor burning. The anchors that keep people stuck in civilization consciousness are usually about safety, belonging, approval - very animal kingdom concerns. When someone burns through those deeper loyalty debts to family and tribe, they can access more of their causal consciousness.

**Participant Insight**: I had an experience last week where I felt connected to something much larger than myself. It wasn't emotional or mental - it was like pure awareness. Is that what you mean by causal consciousness?

**From Marianne**: That sounds like a glimpse of causal consciousness, yes. In Hylozoics terms, you were temporarily accessing a higher world. The question is how to make that more stable, more available. That's where the systematic work comes in.

**From Johan**: And that's why we don't just do one-off experiences. The method is about building the capacity to live from that level more consistently. Each pearl we extract through anchor burning integrates more of that causal understanding into daily life.
