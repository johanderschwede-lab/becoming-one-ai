  - Scovel Shinn: Through alignment with Divine Design
  - Hylozoics: Through dimensional consciousness projection
  - Fourth Way: Through conscious will development

‚óè Resolution of Apparent Contradictions:
  - Fourth Way's "man cannot do" vs others' active manifestation
  - Analysis: Different developmental stages require different approaches

‚óè Personality-Specific Applications:
  - Enneagram Type 4: Neville's imagination approach most effective
  - Human Design Manifestor: Scovel Shinn's divine design alignment
  - [Integrated with personality mapping systems]

‚óè Progressive Study Path:
  1. Start with Neville for practical understanding
  2. Add Scovel Shinn for ethical framework
  3. Study Hylozoics for cosmic context
  4. Integrate Fourth Way for developmental precision

‚óè Truth Synthesis:
