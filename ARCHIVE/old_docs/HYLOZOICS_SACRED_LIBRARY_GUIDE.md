## üöÄ **Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Deploy Database Schema**
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
# Run the schema file:
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f database/schemas/hylozoics_sacred_library_schema.sql
```

### **Step 2: Add Sample Quotes**
```bash
cd /Users/johanniklasson/Documents/becoming-one-ai
python tools/add_hylozoics_quotes.py sample
```

### **Step 3: Update Bot Integration**
The Hylozoics commands need to be integrated into your main Telegram bot. This requires updating the enhanced bot to include the new command handlers.

### **Step 4: Test the System**
```
/hylozoics - Access Sacred Library
Ask: "What is consciousness?"
Expected: Exact quote with full citation
```
