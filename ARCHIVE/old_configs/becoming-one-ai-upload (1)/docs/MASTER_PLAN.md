    # 2. Determine journey stage and appropriate guidance
    journey_stage = assess_development_stage(history, person_id)
    
    # 3. Select relevant Schaubilder and wisdom
    relevant_concepts = match_schaubilder(emotional_context, journey_stage)
    
    # 4. Generate personalized response using Becoming One™ principles
