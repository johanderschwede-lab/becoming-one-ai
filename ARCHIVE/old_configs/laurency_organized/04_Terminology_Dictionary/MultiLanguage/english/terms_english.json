Those who refuse to help when they can, are guilty of an omission that has consequences and by no means the least ones. \"The Brahmins’ conception of karma as being inevitable destiny, that one ‘stands in the way of karma’ by trying to relieve suffering and distress, is evidence of fatal ignorance of life.
