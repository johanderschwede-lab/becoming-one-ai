PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION
Ever since 1984 the Institute for Hylozoic Studies has worked to
promote the study of the esoteric knowledge of life, especially in its Western, hylozoic
(Pythagorean) form. At the very outset of our work, the publishing of an esoteric
vocabulary appeared particularly desirable, not least in order to counteract the confusion
of ideas prevalent in this sphere.
Without any claims whatever to treat of the subject-matter in its
entire depth or to describe exhaustively its terminology, the Institute in December 1986
published the first Swedish edition of the present work to the Scandinavian readers. After
this first edition ran out of print 1991, the work at a new edition was begun, and in 1996
this second edition was published. The present English edition is a translation of the
1996 Swedish edition.
The Esoteric Dictionary is primarily an
inventory of the terminology used by Henry T. Laurency, secondarily of the terminology
used in theosophy and the works of Alice A. Bailey. The Dictionary is intended to
be more than a mere vocabulary. It contains more than 500 entries, the majority of which
besides definitions of the terms also cite excerpts from The
Knowledge of Reality and The Philosopher’s Stone
by Henry T. Laurency, The Knowledge of Reality in particular, since it is the more
important book where the elementary study is concerned. Actually, the main body of the
text of the dictionary is made up of such excerpts. When compiling this Dictionary, the
selection of terms to be entered as well as the formulation of the texts appended to them
was made with a view to presenting esoteric students with a practical tool that they would
find interesting enough to study as a work in its own right, beside the works of Laurency.
References to the works of Laurency are given using the same method as
is consistently used in the Internet edition of his works; that is, not by pages, but by
sections, chapters, and paragraphs. This has been sufficiently explained on the Official
Website of the Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation (Introduction
to the works of Henry T. Laurency).
References between entries are not very numerous. From an educational
point of view, it should prove more expedient that the students go through the Dictionary
several times over and so doing discover for themselves the natural, logical connections
there are between the entries.
The attention of the students is called to the fact that one and the
same entry sometimes is explained twice, as a Laurency term and as a theosophical and/or
Bailey term. MONAD and TRIAD are two such instances where the same terms have different
meanings in different authors. Esoteric students who study both Laurency and
theosophy/Bailey will appreciate the necessity of making such distinctions.
The Esoteric Dictionary can be used by both beginners and more
advanced students to study hylozoics in a new and interesting way.
Abbreviations used in the Dictionary
K = The Knowledge of Reality
P = The Philosopher’s Stone
B. = term used by Alice A. Bailey
f = and the following paragraph
ff = and the following paragraphs
Gr. = Greek
Lat. = Latin
Skt = Sanskrit
T. = term used by theosophical authors
Tib. = Tibetan
Quotations from Laurency are surrounded by quotation marks.
If several continuous paragraphs are quoted, a quotation mark is put at
the beginning of each paragraph but only at the end of the last one.
Every quotation is accompanied by a reference, for example K 1.2.15,
which means that the quotation is from The Knowledge of Reality, section The
Problems of Reality, Part One, chapter two, paragraph 15.
In cases where the information given is taken from a Laurency text that
is not literally quoted, this is shown by putting the reference in brackets (K 1.2.15).
Texts not presented in quotes are written by me.
Needless to say, I am very grateful to receive suggestions from
students and other readers as to possible improvements or additions.

A
ACTIVATION, LAW OF "The law of activation says that individual
development is possible only through self-initiated consciousness activity." K
1.41.14
"All development is the result of work and toil." P 3.23.2
ACTIVATION AND OBJECTIVATION, METHODS OF Methods to activate higher, as
yet inactive consciousness, and to make subjective (emotional and mental) consciousness
objective. "Those esoteric methods, which lead rapidly and without risks to causal
objective consciousness, remain the property of the planetary hierarchy." K 6.8.6
"Unlike the yogis’ methods of activation, the esoteric one is a methodical and
systematical activation of passive consciousness in one after the other of up to then
superconscious molecular kinds. This is done by vitalizing the different chakras of the
different envelopes. Consciousness in each molecular kind is bound up with its particular
chakra. When a chakra is vitalized, subjective consciousness in that molecular kind
ensues. Objective consciousness is obtained by the subjective consciousness in the chakra
activating that molecular kind in the envelope. As has already been pointed out, only the
causal self can use emotional and mental objective consciousness correctly. Until then,
the individual will be the victim of his own ignorance and will retard his higher
development." K 7.22.3
"In each new incarnation the individual in his new envelopes has to repeat the whole
process of activation. If the individual has once received the knowledge and has not
abused it, he will be given occasions to remember his old knowledge anew in new
lives." K 7.22.10
ACTIVATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS "Consciousness activation in the three
lowest natural kingdoms is an unconscious and automatic process which gradually becomes a
conscious one in the human kingdom. In higher kingdoms it is the result of self-initiated
consciousness activity." K 1.28.4
ACTIVATION OF
CONSCIOUSNESS, SYSTEMATIC Systematic activation of consciousness is done in four steps:
concentration, meditation, contemplation and illumination.
"Concentration is the keeping of attention on a certain thing. Meditation implies a
concentrated analysis of all relations pertaining to this subject-matter. Contemplation
entails the isolation of the problem until one begins to see the idea and can concentrate
attention on that single point. If thereby activity ceases, there is a risk of falling
asleep or into ordinary trance. If activity can be kept up long enough, illumination comes
and the individual will find what he has been seeking." K 7.17.9
ACTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS The self-active consciousness that becomes
possible through evolution. Having active consciousness the monads themselves initiate
their consciousness expressions.
In the vegetable and animal kingdoms this activation occurs in groups (through
group-souls). In the human kingdom consciousness becomes more and more self-active.
"Active consciousness is the ability of consciousness to let dynamis act through
it." K 1.28.1
"The expressions of active consciousness induce matter to act as energy." K
1.28.2
ACTUALIZED CONSCIOUSNESS Awakened, functioning consciousness.
"The monad's potential consciousness is awakened to life (is actualized) in the
cosmos." K 1.15.2
Actualized consciousness goes through different degrees of activation: passive, active,
self-active.
ADEPT Esoteric master, 45-self.
ADI (Skt, T.B.) World 43 and its consciousness.
AGGREGATE ENVELOPES All forms of nature are envelopes for monads. All
forms except organisms of the physical world are aggregate envelopes, molecules of the
kinds of matter of the respective worlds held together electro-magnetically. (K 1.13.2)
AGGREGATION, STATES OF Same as molecular kinds.
AGNI (Skt, T.B.) Deva raja of world 47. Symbol of the causal-mental
world.
AGNICHAITANS (Skt, T.B.) Building devas of the physical eterical world.
AGNISHVATTAS (Skt, T.B.) Building devas of the causal-mental world.
AGNISURYANS (Skt, T.B.) Building devas of the emotional world.
AGNOSTIC One who denies the possibility of ascertaining superphysical
facts. (K 1.2.15)
AJNA-CHAKRA (Skt, T.B.) Eyebrow centre.
AKASHA (Skt, T.) World 44 in the solar system.
"AKASHIC RECORDS" (Q.) Such globe memories as can be reached
with emotional clairvoyance (48:4-7). They do not contain the past of the planet, but what
people in all times have believed about this past. The real akasha, the akasha of the
planetary hierarchy, is world 44. (K 6.9)
ANAHATA-CHAKRA (Skt, T.B.) Heart centre.
ANANKE (Gr.) Necessity. Result of the activity of eternal, mechanical
laws of nature.
ANGELS The gnostic and later also Christian term of devas. The
archangels are the seven highest devas of our planet (43-selves) who preside over their
respective departments in the deva hierarchy.
ANIMA MUNDI (Lat.) The "soul of the world", older esoteric
term meaning the collective consciousness in 46–49.
ANIMAL KINGDOM The third natural kingdom of evolution. In the animal
kingdom the monads have principally physical and emotional consciousness. Between
incarnations they are enclosed in common envelopes of mental matter, so-called
group-souls. "The higher up the scale of evolution an animal is, the fewer are the
monads that go to its group." K 1.33.6
"When the monad has been able for a long time to be affected by mental vibrations
(47:7) and has thus attained the highest animal species, it becomes possible for it to
transmigrate to the human kingdom." K 1.33.10
ANIMAL MONAD During its evolution in the animal kingdom the monad is
called animal monad.
"The vegetable monads become animal monads through acquiring emotional consciousness.
When their mental consciousness is sufficiently active, the animal monads pass to the
human kingdom." K 4.8.3
"Having developed so as to acquire an envelope of its own in the causal world, the
animal monad transmigrates to the human kingdom." K 4.8.4
ANTAHKARANA (Skt: "the inner organ", T.B.) That channel for
energy and consciousness which the evolutionary monad builds through its own activity
between its triad units and envelopes as a ladder to climb up to ever higher consciousness
and ability. The antahkarana has its lowest anchorage in the crown centre of the etheric
envelope. (K 7.3.15)
ANTIMETAPHYSICIAN Denier of the existence of superphysical reality.
(K 1.2.15)
ANUPADAKA (Skt, T.B.) World 44 and its consciousness. Synonyms: akasha,
paranirvana.
A PRIORI (Lat.) In advance, i.e. without prior investigation or
experience. Opposite: a posteriori = afterwards, after investigation or experience.
"The correct explanation of the aprioristic in our apprehension was given long ago by
Platon. According to him, there is another kind of certainty than that of ordinary
experience. This certainty is the outcome of remembering anew concepts acquired in
previous incarnations. Everything aprioristic is thus obtained ultimately from
experience." K 5.28.14
ARHAT (Skt, T.B.) 46-self, initiate of the 4th degree.
ARUPA (Skt "without form", T.B.) All matter above 47:4 is
said to be without form, although all matter has form. In a restricted sense and most
often arupa means 47:1-3, the causal world and its kinds of matter; arupa devas are causal
devas.
ASCENDING ARC (T.) Has two meanings:
1. Evolution in general.
2. The three last globe periods in an eon.
ASEKHA (Pali: one trained to completion, T.) Esoteric master, perfected
45-self, initiate of the 5th degree.
ASHRAM (Skt, T.B.) That group which a member of the planetary hierarchy
(at least a 46-self) forms of his disciples and with himself as the focus in the
"power house". The planetary hierarchy consists of seven greater ashrams led by
44-selves and representing the seven departments, and 42 lesser ones led by 45- and
46-selves. The type energies these collective beings emit encompass the planet.
ASTRAL BODY, WORLD etc. (T.B.) The same as emotional envelope, world
etc. However, in Blavatsky’s terminology, "astral" also means the etheric
(49:1-4). (K 3.3.25, 3.5.7)
ASTROLOGY, ESOTERIC "The knowledge of the relations of our solar
system and our planet to other solar systems, of the exchange of interstellar and
interplanetary energies, once was one of the most important sciences in mankind's
possession. The people that got farthest in this respect were the Chaldeans of some 30 000
years ago. Fortunately, we can look forward to the time when the individuals who acquired
this knowledge in Chaldea will incarnate again and once more present mankind with the
esoteric ‘astrology’, thereby reviving the long-lost knowledge."
K 2.13.11
ASTROLOGY, EXOTERIC "Exoteric astrology is not exact. It still
lacks the knowledge of a number of necessary facts. Even with its twelve zodiacal types
and seven planetary types to guide it, it still cannot state their relations to the
existing types. It cannot interpret all the possibilities of the horoscope. It knows
nothing about the horoscope of more than one of the individual's five envelopes.
"The fate of astrology is one of many examples of what will happen when esoteric
knowledge gets into the hands of the uninitiated... The result is superstition of a more
or less gross kind." K 2.13.13f
ATLANTIS Hemispherical continent and abode of the fourth root-race. It
was situated at the present location of the Atlantic and North America and was submerged
into the ocean in four stages: 800 000, 200 000, 75 025 and 9564 BC.
"The Atlanteans were physicalists of repulsive emotionality." K 6.5.7
ATMA (Skt, T.B.) World 45 and its consciousness, 45-envelope of the
second self.
ATOM "Atoms are composed of primordial atoms. The lower the atomic
kind, the more primordial atoms enter into the atom." K 1.10.2
"There are two kinds of atoms: negative and positive. In the negative (receptive)
atoms, material energy flows from a higher atomic kind to a lower; in the positive
(propulsive) atoms, from a lower to a higher. This current is the force that maintains the
atoms, molecules, material aggregates, in their given forms." K 1.27.1
ATOM OF SCIENCE "The chemical so-called atom of science is a
physical etheric molecule (49:4). This molecular kind, like all other molecular kinds,
contains 49 different layers of matter. To reach the real physical atom (49:1), the
nuclear physicists have to work their way through 147 layers of matter, each in succession
higher than the other. No physical science will achieve that." K 1.10.8
ATOMIC CONSCIOUSNESS "Atomic
consciousness is world consciousness. The individual as a joint owner of a consciousness
collective is like a cell in an organism. The organism is an envelope of an individual in
a higher kingdom. When in the collective consciousness of his world the individual has so
developed that he can take over this material world as an envelope of his own, then he
will be a ‘god’ of this world.
"Atomic consciousness, world consciousness, omniscience (in that world) does not mean
that the individual knows everything about everything that is or happens. But it is
possible for him to find out more or less quickly everything he wishes to know,
independently of space and past time in a given world, to ascertain all relations in the
three aspects (matter, motion, and consciousness) of that world." K 1.30.6f
ATOMIC ENERGIES The effect of dynamis through the 49 atomic kinds.
"The atomic energies act from world to world through the atomic kinds" K 1.29.3
ATOMIC MATTER Primordial atoms and matter composed of it is called
atomic matter in contrast to primordial matter. There exist 49 different kinds of atomic
matter called atomic kinds.
"Atomic matter is by nature dynamic." K 1.7.4
ATOMIC MEMORY The collective memory of all atoms in the respective
worlds.
"Only the collective atomic memory of the emotional world is the one that cannot be
falsified, but reproduces exactly past events of the emotional and physical worlds, but
not those of higher worlds." K 6.9.4
ATOMIC KINDS "The cosmos consists of primordial atoms (called
monads by Pythagoras) which are composed to make 49 kinds of atoms, each in succession
coarser than the previous ones, in seven continuous series of seven atomic kinds in each.
These atomic kinds make up the 49 cosmic worlds.
"Each lower atomic kind is formed out of the next higher one (2 out of 1, 3 out of 2,
4 out of 3, etc.). The lowest atomic kind (49) thus contains all the 48 higher kinds. When
an atomic kind is dissolved, the next higher kind is obtained; out of the physical atom
are obtained 49 atoms of atomic kind 48." K 1.7.1f
"Each atomic kind has its own dimension." K 1.8.4
ATOMIZED MANIFESTATIONAL MATTER Matter consisting of the cosmic kinds
of matter 1–49, contrary to the homogeneous primordial matter. (P 2.60.1)
ATTRACTION Attraction characterizes the vibrations of the three higher
kinds of emotional matter (48:2-4). The pertaining consciousness is by the individual
perceived as noble feelings. (K 1.19.5, P 2.31.4ff)
AUGOEIDES (Gr.) Pythagorean term of a certain category of devas who are
46- and 45-selves. They make up collective beings and have tasks closely connected with
the evolution of our mankind. Among other tasks they administer the execution of the law
of destiny in mankind and take care of men’s second triads as long as these are
inactive. Man’s (greater) causal envelope is a gift from Augoeides.
AURA Man’s emotional, mental, and causal envelopes "embrace
and penetrate all the lower ones. They are oval in shape and extend between 30 and 45 cm
beyond the organism, making the so-called aura. Approximately 99 per cent of the matter of
these envelopes is attracted to the organism and is held together within its periphery, so
that the aggregate envelopes form complete replicas of the former." K 4.9.1
AUTOMATIZATION The monad reaches the highest level of consciousness
(objective self-consciousness) in a kind of matter when it completely dominates the
corresponding envelope of the monad and its consciousness functions have been taken over
by the next higher envelope through automatization. (P 2.27.5, 2.41.5)
AVATAR (Skt) Higher being, 45-self or even higher self, incarnating in
mankind to assist us.
B
BARBARISM, STAGE OF The first or lowest of man’s five stages of
development. It is characterized by the fact that physical and the repulsive emotional
consciousness are the most important.
"The individual at the stage of barbarism as a physical self only, without emotional
and mental consciousness worth mentioning, belongs on the very lowest levels of the stage
of barbarism. Immediately after causalization he is little more than an animal, often not
even so intelligent." K 1.34.12
So primitive men do not incarnate in our humanity any longer. Even the least developed
have at least 30 000 incarnations in the human kingdom, yet they are at the stage of
barbarism.
"On the higher levels of the stage of barbarism, his mental consciousness is
activated to the extent that he is able to draw simple conclusions." K 1.34.12
BASIC TENDENCIES OF INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER "In every individual
character two basic tendencies can be discerned, which pervade all nature; the opposition
of positive and negative, active and passive, attractive and repellent. One of the two
tendencies preponderates in every individual. In some, either tendency is driven to
extremes." P 3.48.7
"Development in monads of repulsive basic tendency can take a wrong course, this
showing already in parasitism of plants and in predacity of animals." K 4.11.4
BEING "‘Being’ bears on the consciousness aspect. All
material forms with a unitary consciousness are beings." P 2.11.2
Individual beings (monads) and collective beings (composed of monads) are distinguished.
Viewed individually, the monad’s material envelopes are beings. Man consists of five
beings, which it is the monad’s task to control.
BELIEF "is absolute, unreasonable emotional conviction, unamenable
to correction or reason. Everybody has his petty beliefs about almost any absurdity, and
this is because man is unable to truly know anything but definitively established facts in
the visible world. In contrast, assumption, is preliminary, valid only until one has come
to know, in amenable to rational arguments, and desires correction." K 1.2.11
BHAGAVAN (Skt, "the lord") Title of the planetary ruler, the
head of the planetary government. (K 7.14.3)
BODHISATTVA (Skt, T.B.) See WORLD-TEACHER
BODY Older term of body. ‘Envelope’ is a better term, since
it indicates its purpose: to envelop the monad.
BRAHMA (Skt, T.B.) One of the aspects of Trimurti. The symbol refers
generally to the matter aspect; specifically to collective beings whose special task is
the formation of matter. Also a name of the deva raja of world 45.
BRAHMA, DAYS AND NIGHTS OF Periods of activity and passivity of a
duration of 4320 million years. Also called kalpas or eons.
BRANCH-RACE See RACES
BUDDHA (Skt, "the awakened one") Title of a 42-self, initiate
of the 8th degree. Gautama Buddha is the fourth buddha in the current eon. His three
predecessors were called Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kashyapa (K 6.12.33)
BUDDHI (Skt, T.B.) World 46 and its consciousness, the 46-envelope of
the second self.
C
CAUSAL has reference to the material reality of the causal world
(47:1-3), its consciousness and energy. The causes of lower kinds of reality are found in
this world, hence its name.
CAUSAL CONSCIOUSNESS "Causal consciousness (47:1-3) is possible
only for those who have developed so far ahead of the rest of mankind that they can
purposefully prepare for their transition to the next higher kingdom. They have acquired
the ability to associate with everybody in the causal world, the meeting-place for the
individuals belonging to the fourth as well as the fifth natural kingdom.
"Causal consciousness is subjectively intuition, the experiencing of causal ideas,
and makes it possible to study objectively the physical, emotional, and mental worlds, and
makes omniscience in these worlds possible.
"To causal consciousness there is, in planetary respect (the worlds of man: 47- 49), neither distance nor past time." K 1.20.8ff
CAUSAL ENVELOPE The monad’s envelope of causal matter (47:1-3).
The causal envelope is the only envelope that is permanent throughout the monad’s
sojourn in the human kingdom. It was acquired at the monad’s transition from the
animal to the human kingdom. It is the causal envelope that incarnates, together with
human monad, which it always encloses, into four lower envelopes, which are soon
dissolved. (K 1.14.2, 1.34.2, 4.8.4)
The causal envelope "retains the memory of all the human incarnations and of the
experiences had, of insight and understanding gained, of qualities and abilities
acquired." K 1.34.35
"During incarnation the first self has two causal bodies. This condition lasts until
the monad becomes a causal self. At the time of involvation the causal body is divided
into two. The greater part, serving as a collector of matter supplied, remains in the
causal world. The smaller world (the triad envelope), containing the lowest triad,
encloses the lower bodies. When the involvation of the first self is concluded and the
personality is dissolved, the two separate parts amalgamate to form one single causal
body. The four centres of the causal body do not belong to the involving triad envelope.
It is these two causal bodies that have been called the ‘twin souls’ and have
occasioned fantasies of all sorts." P 2.23.6
CAUSAL LIFE BETWEEN INCARNATIONS "Upon the dissolution of the
mental envelope, the individual in his causal envelope sinks into dreamless sleep that
will last until the time comes for rebirth and an embryo has been formed for him in a
physical maternal body... There can be no conscious causal life unless the intuition of
the causal ideas has been acquired in physical existence... The monad’s continuity of
consciousness, made possible through the memory in its incarnation envelopes now
dissolved, has been lost." K 1.34.34f
CAUSAL-MENTAL WORLD Atomic world 47 in the cosmos and solar system and
molecular world 47:2-7 in the solar system.
CAUSAL SELF Monad that has its most important kind of subjective and
objective self-consciousness in atomic world 47:1 and molecular world 47:2,3 within the
solar system. Causal selves belonging to mankind are at the stage of ideality and have
consciousness in 47:2,3, causal selves in the fifth natural kingdom have consciousness in
47:1.
"The causal self is able to study all its previous lives as a man, is able
independently and quickly to acquire the facts necessary to comprehend all realities in
the worlds of man, achieving more in one hour (in 47:1) than the most efficient mental
thinker could manage in one hundred years. Fictions are precluded." K 1.20.10
The causal self can ascertain that the esoteric world view and life view agrees with facts
in the five worlds of man (47- 49). (K 4.11.8)
CAUSAL WORLD Atomic world 47 (47:1) and molecular world 47:2,3 in the
solar system. The causal world (47:1-3) is the world of Platonic ideas and man’s goal
in the human kingdom. The causal world is "the meeting place for the individuals
belonging to the fourth as well as the fifth natural kingdom." K 1.20.8
"The causal world, the world of Platonic ideas, belongs to the planetary hierarchy,
being accessible to those who have acquired causal consciousness. The causal ideas
reproduce reality such as it can be rendered in this kind of consciousness. The Indian
elaborator of the raja yoga system, Patanjali, called the idea content of the causal world
the ‘rain-clouds of knowable things’." K 2.17.5
CAUSAL WORLD, IDEAS OF See IDEAS
OF THE CAUSAL WORLD
CAUSALIZATION "By acquiring a causal envelope the monad
transmigrates from the animal kingdom to the human kingdom. To term this process
‘causalization’ is preferable to ‘individualization’, since the monad
is an individual in all kingdoms."
"Only the monkey, elephant, dog, horse, and cat, which belong to group-souls of very
few monads, are able to causalize." K 1.33.6
CENTRES OF AGGREGATE
ENVELOPES (= CHAKRAS) "All higher envelopes, like the organism, have their special
organs (made of atoms), which are the seats of the different kinds of functions of
consciousness and of motion. These atomic organs in the etheric, emotional, mental, and
causal envelopes are in contact with each other." K 1.14.6
"Each molecular kind has its own characteristic kind of consciousness, which in
man’s envelopes is perceptible through special organs of perception (chakras). The
physical sense organs have their counterparts in the centres of perception and activity in
man’s aggregate envelopes.
"It is by means of the chakras that man is able in his organism to perceive
subjectively the vibrations in his higher envelopes and thereby experience feelings and
thoughts, etc. In order to acquire objective consciousness through these chakras special
methods of activation are required." K 6.8.3f
"Chakras have positions that can be given in reference to the organism.
"The seven most important chakras in the etheric, emotional, and mental envelopes,
receiving their energies from the seven departments, are:
above the diaphragm: crown (1st dep.), eyebrow (4th dep.), throat (3rd
dep.), heart (2nd dep.).
below the diaphragm: solar plexus (navel, 6th dep.), sacral (5th dep.), basal (7th
dep.)."
"The chakras below the diaphragm were already developed in
Lemurians and now fulfil all their requisite functions automatically as organs of
apprehension and activity. In contrast, the chakras above the diaphragm are but little
developed at mankind’s present stage of development and mostly only slightly active.
"Of the chakras in the causal envelope of the ‘normal individual', which form a
lotus-like organ, only those three are slightly developed which during incarnations are in
contact with the heart and crown chakras of the etheric, emotional, and mental envelopes.
"Normally, the throat chakra is developed at the stage of civilization, the heart
chakra at the stage of culture, the eyebrow chakra at the stage of humanity, and the crown
chakra at the stage of ideality. But full functional capacity is achieved only when the
causal self succeeds in becoming an essential self. Until then only few petals are
active." K 7.22.4ff
CHAKRAS (Skt, "wheels") Centres in man’s physical
etheric, emotional, mental, and causal envelopes; centres which are organs for specialized
energy and consciousness. See CENTRES OF
AGGREGATE ENVELOPES
CHELA (Hindi, T.B.) Disciple
CHOHAN (Tibetan and Mongolian, T.B.) Perfected 44-self, initiate of the
6th degree. Title of the head of one of the seven departments of the planetary hierarchy.
CHRISTOS (Gr.) Gnostic symbol for the fifth natural kingdom and
especially essential consciousness. Title of the head of the second department of the
planetary hierarchy, the world teacher.
CIVILIZATION, STAGE OF The second of man’s five stages of
development.
"The emotional consciousness of the civilizational individual seldom extends beyond
the lower three or four molecular kinds, his mental consciousness seldom over the lowest
two. With this modest intellectual capacity he intellectualizes his desires into such
emotions as normally exist in the lower regions of the emotional world. Generally, they
are of the repulsive kind." K 1.34.15
CLAN Group of monads that are at the same stage of development and
incarnate together. (K 1.34.10, 5.5.1)
CLAIRVOYANCE Objective consciousness in the emotional and mental
worlds. "So-called clairvoyance does not provide any real knowledge, since man lacks
the prerequisites of judging the reality content of his experiences in the emotional and
mental worlds. This is also obvious from the fact that all clairvoyants have dissimilar
views." K 3.8.3
"The planetary hierarchy has repeatedly warned against the use of emotional or mental
clairvoyance. What one gets to know in the emotional world is not the knowledge of
existence, reality, and life. Like the mental world, it is intended to be a sojourn of
rest pending a new incarnation. It is only in the physical and causal worlds that man is
able to ascertain real facts, not in the emotional and mental worlds. In these worlds one
cannot know whether what one sees is nature’s enduring reality or not." K 6.9.6
(K 6.12.26)
CLASSES "Classes are the natural order of things. The natural
classes indicate different classes of age, in the human kingdom as well as in all other
natural kingdoms, both lower and higher ones." K 4.11.1 (K 5.48.16)
COLLECTIVE BEINGS In all natural kingdoms the monads form collective
beings. In the three subhuman kingdoms, non-self-conscious monads form group-souls. In the
human kingdom, the development of self-consciousness becomes the essential purpose, and so
man’s consciousness of the collective beings he is part of (groups, clans, etc.)
remains passive (according to the law of separation). In the superhuman kingdoms, the
monad, with its self-consciousness preserved, enters into ever larger collectives and has
common consciousness with the monads entering into them.
"Every world, every planet, solar system, etc., thus has its own collective
consciousness, and constitutes a unitary collective being having one monad as the superior
dominant. The higher the kingdom attained by the monad, the greater its participation in
the cosmic total consciousness. When the monad has acquired planetary consciousness it is
a planetary being. When, finally, it has actualized its potential universal consciousness,
it has become an individual unit in cosmic omniscience and omnipotence." K 4.7.3
COLLECTIVE BEINGS, TASKS OF "All essential and higher beings are
part of expanding collective beings." P 2.51.1 "The tasks of these collective
beings can be summed up in three main groups on the basis of the three aspects: the matter
aspect, the consciousness aspect, and the will aspect. Accordingly we have formers of
matter, supervisors of evolution, and restorers of balance." P 2.52.1
COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS "All consciousness is at the same time
collective consciousness. This is so because there is no personal isolation, although only
those who have acquired essential consciousness (46) can live in the collective
consciousness.
"There are innumerable kinds of collective consciousness: atomic, molecular,
aggregate, world, planetary, systemic, and after these, different kinds of cosmic
consciousness. The higher the kingdom attained by the monad, the more is embraced by the
collective consciousness in which the self, with its self-consciousness preserved,
experiences other selves as its own larger self.
"Or, to put it differently, all consciousness in the whole cosmos constitutes a
common, inevitable, indivisible unity in which every individual has a smaller or greater
part, depending on the level of development he has attained." K 1.16.3ff
"The collective consciousness is the primary and common one; the individual
self-consciousness the individual must acquire by himself throughout ever higher natural
kingdoms, this being possible because of his very participation in the collective
consciousness." K 2.4.2
"Anything that can form a collective consciousness by reason of some kind of
relatedness, automatically constitutes one." K 2.4.4
COMMON SENSE is the individual’s synthetic instinct of life
acquired through his incarnations. It is his highest sense which he should strive to
develop. (K 1.2.11)
"Common sense is critical reason, everybody’s highest reason. Common sense
relativizes, strives for objectivity, corrects itself, hardly ever expresses final
opinions, and does not base opinions on incomplete facts and insufficient
experience." P 1.1.17

OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SYSTEMATIC
CONSCIENCE "So-called conscience is a complex of fear,
superstition, prejudice, vanity, habits, and other qualities, the proportions varying
according to aptitude, upbringing, and influence from the environment." K 5.33.10
CONSCIOUSNESS One of the three aspects of existence. Consciousness in
the primordial atoms is from the beginning potential (unconscious), is gradually awakened
in the process of manifestation to actualized passive consciousness subsequently to become
ever more active in the ever higher worlds of ever higher natural kingdoms.
The most important insight about the nature of consciousness is that all consciousness is
simultaneously collective consciousness. (K 1.16.3)
"There is only one consciousness is the cosmos, the cosmic total consciousness, of
which every monad has an inalienable part. This consciousness is an amalgamation of the
consciousness of all monads in the cosmos." K 2.4.1
CONSCIOUSNESS, CONTINUITY OF
Man’s continuity of consciousness is made possible through the memories in the
envelopes of incarnation (47:4- 49:7). Consciousness is lost
after each incarnation because of the dissolution of these envelopes. In contrast, the
causal envelope retains the memory of all human incarnations. When man, at the stage of
ideality, acquires causal self-consciousness in the waking consciousness of his brain, he
has a possibility of unbroken continuity of consciousness for all time to come. (K
1.34.35)
CONSCIOUSNESS, CONTROL OF Process in which the monad by its active
self-consciousness gradually acquires full mastery of the passive consciousness of its
envelopes. As a result, the monad can itself determine what feelings and thoughts, etc. it
wants to have or not to have. (K 7.17, P 3.71f)
CONSCIOUSNESS DEVELOPMENT "Mechanical events, being in accordance
with eternal laws of nature, serve the great cosmic purpose: the development of every
atomic consciousness from unconsciousness to omniscience. The experiences of the
individual consciousness and the working up of these are added to that fund of latent
experience in the subconscious which is steadily increased throughout the incarnations and
makes it possible for the individual to comprehend and understand more and more, to
acquire knowledge of reality and life, discover the laws of existence and learn to apply
them rationally. Being purposeful, the laws of life make consciousness development
possible." K 5.35.3
CONSCIOUSNESS, DIFFERENT KINDS OF "One must distinguish between
self-consciousness (individual consciousness, self-consciousness in the envelopes),
collective consciousness, and ultimate self consciousness. (Technically, cosmic, systemic,
and planetary consciousness can be distinguished.)" K 1.16.1
"There are as many different kinds of consciousness as there are kinds of matter.
Each world has its own total consciousness, as each monad envelope has its own." K
4.7.2
CONSCIOUSNESS, HIGHER AND LOWER KINDS OF "As a higher kind of
matter penetrates lower consciousness. On the other hand, a lower kind cannot apprehend
higher kinds, which always appear non-existent." K 2.4.1
CONSCIOUSNESS TYPES, HUMAN "The seven planetary types only exist
in the worlds of the planetary hierarchy (43- 46).
"The pure human types do not exist in the human kingdom at its present stage of
development. They will not appear until in the last or seventh root-race."
"Man’s five envelopes can belong to five different departments. The incarnation
envelopes can belong to five different departments. The incarnation envelopes usually
change in departments in each new life, so that the individual is continually changing
‘type’. He can have something of all the five types."
"Only 46-selves can ascertain to which department the five different envelopes
belong. Accordingly, there is no point in speculating as to the type to which an
individual belongs." K 2.7.1f,4,7
CONTEMPLATION See ACTIVATION
OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SYSTEMATIC
CONTINUOUS CONSCIOUSNESS See CONTINUITY
OF CONSCIOUSNESS
CONTROL OF ENVELOPES "Man’s five envelopes all have their own
consciousnesses and their own tendencies. Those of the organism are inherited from
one’s parents. The qualities and abilities, etc. that the self acquires in its
emotional and mental envelopes have their correspondences in a cluster of atoms (Sanskrit:
skandhas), are preserved by the causal envelope, and used at reincarnation. It is the task
of the self to learn to master its envelopes, so that they submit to its will. This is no
easy task, since the tendencies of the envelopes are the result of habits from thousands
of incarnations. At mankind’s present stage of development, the emotional controls
the physical. Man still has to learn to control the emotional by the mental. And more than
good resolutions is needed to do that. It can take many lives once one has seen the need
for it." K 1.34.24
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS Different kinds of omniscience in worlds 1- 42 belonging to the cosmos (atomic worlds 43-
49 make up the material of the solar system, and that is why they are not counted as being
part of the cosmos). The lowest kind of cosmic consciousness (42) thus has the highest
kind of solar systemic consciousness (43) as its precondition. The ‘cosmic
consciousness’ of diverse clairvoyants (Steiner, Martinus, etc.) is objective
consciousness in the emotional world (48). It affords no knowledge of reality.
COSMIC IDEAS "The entire process of manifestation proceeds in
accordance with cosmic ideas." K 2.15.4
"It is our planetary government which is entrusted with the cosmic ideas pertaining
to the maintenance and development of life in the planet and which also sees to it that
they are realized in accordance with the laws." K 2.16.3
COSMIC KINGDOMS "All we know about these six successively higher
divine kingdoms in the 42 higher atomic worlds is that they exist, that they constitute a
perfect cosmic organization working with unfailing precision in accordance with all
existence's laws of nature and life.
"In the cosmos, the individual does not acquire any envelopes of his own. He succeeds
to some high function and, finally, to the highest in his world with its collective
consciousness, and identifies himself with this world as his own envelope.
"The individuals of the second divine kingdom aspire towards omniscience in the
worlds 36- 42 (only now ‘cosmic consciousness’),
those of the third divine kingdom towards omniscience in the worlds 29-
35, etc." K 1.37.1ff
COSMIC MOTION "Cosmic motion (in the 49 atomic kinds) is the
result of a constant current of primordial atoms (primary matter) flowing down from the
highest atomic world through the atoms of all the worlds unto the lowest world. These
primordial atoms then return to the highest world to begin their circulation anew, and
this continues as long as the existence of the lower worlds is necessary. There are two
kinds of atoms: negative and positive. In the negative (receptive), material energy flows
from a higher atomic kind to a lower; in the positive (propulsive), from a lower to a
higher. It is this current that maintains the atoms, molecules, material aggregates, in
their given forms." K 1.27.1 (P 2.57.2, 2.12.7)
1) In P, the opposite polarity is stated because the starting-point is the opposite and so
the terminology is adapted to this condition.
COSMIC PHYSICAL etc. (T.B.) Worlds 43- 49
are called cosmic physical (and so 49 is cosmic dense, 48 cosmic liquid, 47 cosmic
gaseous, etc.); worlds 36- 42, cosmic astral; 29- 35 cosmic mental; 22- 28 cosmic buddhic,
etc.
COSMOS, THE A cosmos is a globe in primordial matter, a globe made up
of primordial atoms.
"Its original dimensions are small, but, being supplied with primordial atoms from
the inexhaustible store of primordial matter, it grows incessantly until it has reached
the requisite size."
"A fully built out cosmos, such as ours, consists of a continuous series of material
worlds of different degrees of density, the higher penetrating all the lower. The highest
world thus penetrates everything in the cosmos.
"The worlds are built out from the highest world, each higher world supplying
material for the next lower world which is formed in and out of the higher ones.
"These are seven series of seven cosmic material worlds, making 49 in all (1- 7, 8- 14, 15-
21, 22- 28, 29- 35, 36- 42, 43- 49), in accordance with the
constant division into seven departments. These atomic worlds occupy the same space in the
cosmos. All the higher worlds embrace and penetrate the lower worlds."
"All the 49 worlds differ from each other as to dimension, duration, material
composition, motion, and consciousness; due to differences in density of primordial atoms.
"The seven lowest cosmic worlds (43- 49) contain billions
of solar systems. The lowest world (49) is the physical world.
"Our cosmos is a perfect organization." K 1.6.1ff
COSMOS, BUILDERS OF THE "The cosmos has been built out by a
collectivity of monads who have acquired consciousness in a cosmos and have themselves
worked their way up through all its 49 worlds. They wish, in their turn, to awaken to
consciousness the unconscious monads in primordial matter and make to possible for them to
acquire omniscience and omnipotence in the cosmos." K 2.2.9
"When a sufficient number of monads have succeeded in working their way from the
lowest natural kingdom up to the highest divine kingdom, this collective being is able to
leave its cosmic globe in order to begin to build out a cosmic globe of its own in
primordial matter, the material being primordial atoms taken from the inexhaustible store
of primordial matter." K 4.5.5
CULTURE "Culture in the esoteric sense of word is only achieved
through purposeful, conscious or unconscious, application of the laws of life. In order to
be discovered they must first have been applied." K 5.7.13
"Cultures are built up by clans at the stages of culture and humanity. When their
work is taken over by clans at lower stages, a more or less swift decline sets in." K
5.5.1
"Emotional and mental culture are the kinds of culture most important for the
realization of unity. Material culture will follow as a matter of course when the good
will to mutual assistance is made the highest value and norm." P 1.1.14
"We shall have social culture when individuals feel that they exist for the
community, and the community feels that it exists for the individual; when everybody
regards service as his foremost task." P 1.1.12
CULTURE, STAGE OF The third of man’s five stages of development.
"It is at the cultural stage that the three highest molecular kinds of the emotional
envelope are activated. The pertaining vibrations in the emotional world are mainly
attractive. Having once attained these regions, the individual can gradually free himself
from the tendency, since long acquired, to a repellent attitude to the surrounding world
and to himself. His feelings become more and more ennobled with each higher level and
supersede his previous receptivity to the countless expressions of hatred of the repellent
vibrations. For everything that is not love is hatred." K 1.34.16 Synonyms: higher
emotional stage, stage of the mystic.
D
"DEATH" "The monads are the only indestructible things
in the universe. There is no ‘death’, just new forms for the monad
consciousness. When the form has fulfilled its temporary purpose for the consciousness
development of the monad, it is dissolved." K 4.4.2
DEATH PROCESS The process at the end of incarnation, when the monad in
the superphysical envelopes leaves the two physical envelopes (organism and etheric
envelope), after the tie that unifies the monad with these, the sutratma, is severed
definitively.
Even during profound sleep, the emotional envelope along with the higher envelopes is
separated from the physical ones. The difference here is that the sutratma upholds the
connection between the monad and the physical. (K 1.34.26f, 3.5.11)
"At the same time as the etheric envelope frees itself from the organism in the
so-called process of death, the emotional envelope frees itself from the etheric envelope
which remains near the organism and dissolves along with it." K 1.34.26
DEDUCTION The method of concluding the less general or the individual
case from knowledge of the more general (the system). Opposite: induction (K 5.17.1,8)
DEPARTMENT One of the seven omnipresent
fundamental types of existence.
DESCENDING ARC (T.) Means involution in general, but also the three
first globe periods of an eon.
DESCENT OF SPIRIT INTO MATTER (T.) A symbolic expression meaning many
things, i.e. involution and the different kinds of involvation. (K 3.4.9)
DESTINY, LAW OF "The law of destiny indicates what forces
influence the individual in consideration of necessary experiences." K 1.41.12
DEVACHAN (Tib. "state of joy", T.B.) The state in the mental
world (47:4-7) between incarnations. Synonyms: tushita (Skt).
DEVA EVOLUTION Line of evolution parallel to the "human
evolution". The deva monads pursue their own path after the mineral kingdom, which is
common to all evolutionary beings, and thus they do not become humans although they reach
the corresponding kinds of active self-consciousness. Branches reach the deva evolution
even from the vegetable and animal kingdoms of the "human evolution". Deva
monads at evolutionary stages corresponding to the vegetable and animal kingdoms are
called nature beings (or nature spirits), those at stages corresponding to the human
kingdom and higher kingdoms are called devas.
DEVA RAJAS (T.B.) The seven highest devas within the solar system. Each
one is responsible for matter in someone of the seven solar systemic worlds. In Sanskrit
they are called: Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Indra, Agni, Varuna, Kshiti.
DEVAS (Skt, "the shining ones") Evolutionary beings belonging
to an evolutionary line parallel to the "human" evolution from mineral via man
to 43-self. The majority of devas have never been and will never become human. Their
lowest consciousness corresponds to that of man; their highest is 43-consciousness. Lower
beings than devas on this evolutionary path are called nature beings. The devas lack a
triad chain. Their lowest envelope is the etheric. They make up two major groups of
collective beings: those who work especially with the motion aspect and are agents of the
laws of life; those who particularly work with the matter aspect and supervise
form-building in nature. The highest deva for an entire material world within the solar
system is called a deva raja.
DEVELOPMENT, LAW OF "The law of development says that all monads
develop their consciousness, that there are forces acting in different ways towards the
final goal of life." K 1.41.10
DHARMA "Dharma is the innermost nature of every individual, that
which constitutes his true being. Dharma is what is given in the interdependent
arrangement of things... Dharma is the meaning of life for every individual.
"Man’s dharma is different at different stages of development, in different
circumstances of life. Everybody has his special dharma, his problems of life to solve,
his duties to perform. Man lives in a state of insecurity and uncertainty when he is not
acting at the best of his ability, in accordance with his dharma. The dharma of mankind is
humanity." K 7.9.3f
DIMENSION "Each atomic kind has its own dimension. Thus there are
49 dimensions in the cosmos. In the cosmic sense, dimension means kind of space. Physical
matter has one dimension (line and area are not counted), the highest kind of matter has
forty-nine. With the 49th dimension, the cosmos becomes a point to primordial atomic
consciousness." K 1.8.4
DISCIPLESHIP "In order to attain the fifth natural kingdom in just
a few incarnations, the aspirant must strive after discipleship under the planetary
hierarchy. Only those who have acquired the physical, emotional, and mental prerequisites
can be accepted as disciples. Physically and dietetically, the athlete training for the
Olympic Games may serve as an example. Emotionally, they must discard all manifestations
of repulsion (hatred) and acquire the qualities of attraction. Mentally, they must acquire
perspective consciousness and a well-developed ability to meditate in the correct way. All
qualities and abilities have to be put solely at the service of evolution, since their
egoistic use counteracts evolution." K 7.22.12
DISCURSIVITY The quality of the lower mental (47:6,7) of not being able
to survey wholes but having to deal with isolated parts in succession.
DIVINE KINGDOMS The seven higher of the twelve natural kingdoms of the
cosmos are called divine kingdoms. The first, or lowest, divine kingdom is made up of
monads that have envelopes and are omniscient and omnipotent in the two highest worlds of
the solar system (43,44); the six higher divine kingdoms are made up of monads that are
omniscient and omnipotent in worlds 36- 42, 29- 35, 22- 28, 15-
21, 8- 14, 1- 7. (K 1.37, 4.5.3)
DOMINANT The highest developed individual in a some permanent
collective consciousness (i.e. planetary ruler).
"There must be one dominant (being one eon ahead of those following next in
consciousness development, consciousness expansion), since final decisions must be
unambiguous and divergence be impossible." K 2.16.7
"Every world, every planet, solar system, etc., thus has its own collective
consciousness, and constitutes a unitary collective being having one monad as the superior
dominant." K 4.7.3
DREAMS Consciousness activity during the organism’s sleep may have
five different causes: discharge of memory pictures of the previous day from the
organism’s brain; impressions from without (during sleep) on the etheric brain;
experiences of the monad in the separated emotional envelope (together with higher
envelopes) in the emotional world; the corresponding in the mental world; glimpses of
causal consciousness (the two last mentioned cases occur seldom before the stage of
humanity).
DURATION Time-lapse
DYNAMIC ENERGY OF PRIMORDIAL MATTER See DYNAMIS
DYNAMIS "The original cause of motion, the
source of all power, the one primordial force, the universe’s total energy, is the
dynamic energy of primordial matter, which Pythagoras called dynamis. It is eternally
active, inexhaustible, unconscious, absolute omnipotence.
"Dynamis acts in every primordial atom, and only in the primordial atoms, which
penetrate all matter.
"Dynamis is the fundamental cause of the perpetuum mobile of the universe." K
1.25.1ff
E
EGO (SELF, HIGHER SELF, T.B.) Term meaning, according
to the context:
1. The second triad and its (activated) consciousness in general
2. Causal consciousness (in the second triad mental atom) in particular.
3. Non-involving greater causal envelope (P 2.23.6), in contrast to the triad envelope
(which B. calls the "personality").
4. Augoeides.
ELEMENT "The ‘elements’ of the ancients … namely,
earth, water, air, fire, and quinta essentia were their terms of the five lowest molecular
kinds, or states of aggregation." K 1.10.9
ELEMENTAL "Involutionary beings, or elementals, are aggregates of
involutionary atoms and molecules. Permanent, semipermanent, and shortlived elementals are
distinguished. The permanent ones are material envelopes of evolutionary beings, the
temporary ones are other vibrational products." P 2.11.3
ELEMENTAL MATTER Matter whose constituent monads, atoms, and molecules
are in involution down to world 49. Elemental matter has passive consciousness. It is
incapable of self-activity but is unsurpassably sensitive to all kinds of vibrations. (K
2.9.2) Synonyms: involutionary matter, secondary matter.
ELEMENTARY (T.) Envelope, ‘shell’, abandoned by an
evolutionary monad, a man, for instance, at the end of incarnation. It is mostly
elementaries that appear at spiritist séances, which explains the deficient intelligence
of the "spirits" and their robotism.
ELITE THINKING The second highest kind of
thinking in the mental envelope (47:5) "élite thinking, is - in contrast to
principle thinking which mostly absolutifies - partly consistent relativizing and
percentualizing thinking, partly perspective thinking and system thinking." K 1.20.5
EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS
Consciousness of the monad, in the emotional envelope (48:2-7).
"By nature emotional consciousness is exclusively desire, or what the individual at
the emotional stage perceives as dynamic will. At the stage of barbarism, before the
individual’s consciousness in the mental envelope has been activated, desire is
manifested as more or less uncontrolled impulses. When the mental envelope, influenced by
the vibrations of the emotional envelope, is attracted to and woven together with the
emotional envelope, mental consciousness is awakened to life, and desire and thought
merge. If desire then preponderates, there ensues feeling, which is desire coloured with
thought. If thought preponderates, imagination ensues, which is thought coloured with
desire.
"Man's emotional life is in the main the life of emotional illusions. He is the
victim of desire's wishful thinking, of the illusions of emotional thinking. The
individual is completely free of the illusions of only after he has acquired causal
consciousness.
"The vibrations of the three lower emotional molecular kinds are largely repellent,
the three higher, attractive. Noble feelings are manifestations of attraction." K
1.19.5
"Sense perceptions excepted, emotionality can be said to include everything
psychological that does not belong to the purely rational, and the purely rational does
not embrace much." P 1.2.2
EMOTIONAL CULTURE "The stage of emotional culture has been reached
when everybody serves and nobody feels like a master. When everybody serves something
higher, something beyond himself, something for several, for many, for all together, then
that harmony will present itself which is the expression of cultured emotion. The present
intellectual possibilities of man have been overrated, and his emotional ones undervalued
and neglected. It is also easier to realize emotional culture, with the sense of unity as
its highest value." P 1.1.11
EMOTIONAL ENVELOPE The monad’s envelope of emotional matter
(48:2-7). In the mineral and vegetable kingdom the emotional envelope belongs to the
group-soul; in the animal and human kingdoms the monad has an individual emotional
envelope. The emotional envelope is the seat of desires. In the human kingdom, when the
mental envelope is activated, the emotional envelope coalesces with the mental so that the
two make up, from the functional point of view, one envelope. Through this originate the
two emotional-mental kinds of consciousness: feeling and imagination.
EMOTIONAL EON Current eon of our planet (lasting 4320 million years).
It is chiefly intended to activate emotional consciousness.
EMOTIONAL LIFE BETWEEN INCARNATIONS "Man’s life in the
emotional world can prove completely different for different individuals, depending on
their developmental level.
"Like the physical world, the emotional world has six successively higher regions.
Most people are nowadays objectively conscious from the beginning in the three regions
(48:5-7) that correspond to the three lowest regions of the physical world (49:5-7)...
Objects in those regions are material counterparts of the material forms of the physical
world, which fact often causes the newcomer to think that he still lives in the physical
world."
"The emotional envelope dissolves gradually: first its lowest molecular kind, then
the lowest but one, etc. When the three lowest are dissolved it is not possible for the
individual to contact the visible physical world."
"In the three higher regions of the emotional world, the existing material forms are
imaginative formations made by the individuals in those regions. For emotional matter
forms itself in accordance with the slightest hint from consciousness, the ignorant
neither understanding the cause nor being able to grasp how it happened. The individual
seldom learns anything really new while in the emotional world and in the mental world
never.
"The life of the emotional envelope can vary as greatly as that of the
organism." K 34.27ff
EMOTIONAL SELF Monad whose most important kind of self-consciousness is
within the molecular worlds 48:2-7 of the solar system. Human emotional selves are at the
stages of civilization and culture.
EMOTIONAL STAGE "As an emotional self (at the stages of
civilization and culture), the individual is in his thinking and acting determined by
emotional motives. The emotional stage is the most difficult stage of development. Man
must by himself acquire consciousness in all six molecular kinds of his emotional envelope
and in the two lowest of his mental envelope. To the emotional stage belongs almost
everything that man today regards as civilization and culture." K 1.34.13
EMOTIONAL THINKING "At his present stage of development, man is an
emotional being with a possibility of intermittent use of his still undeveloped reason.
"Sense perception excepted, emotionality can be said to include everything
psychological that does not belong to the purely rational, and the purely rational does
not embrace much. Our consciousness is centred in emotionality, which colours sense
perceptions as well as thoughts. Our consciousness is centred in emotionality, which
colours sense perceptions as well as thoughts." P 1.2.1f
"Emotional thinking rules in all domains that can directly or indirectly affect
personal interests." P 3.16.3
EMOTIONAL WORLD Atomic world 48 in the cosmos and solar system,
molecular world 48:2-7 in the planets of the solar system. The molecular emotional world
can be said to be the particular world of animals where consciousness is concerned. (K
1.11.5)
"What one gets to know in the emotional world is not the knowledge of existence,
reality, and life. Like the mental world, it is intended to be a sojourn for rest pending
a new incarnation. It is only in the physical and causal worlds that man is able to
ascertain real facts, not in the emotional and mental worlds. In these worlds one cannot
know whether what one sees is nature's enduring reality or not.
"In the emotional world one has confirmation of all one’s illusions and
fictions, one’s hypotheses and theories, and all other fancies." K 6.9.6f
EMOTIONALIST Man at the emotional stage (stages of civilization and
culture).
ENERGY "In the scientific sense of the word, energy is matter in
motion. All higher kinds of matter (atomic kinds, molecular kinds) are energy in relation
to all lower kinds.
"Matter in not dissolved into energy, but into higher matter.
"When matter ceases to move, its quality of being energy ceases.
"All forces of nature are matter." K 1.26.1ff
"The energies that become manifest are the effects of the next higher molecular kinds
upon the next lower ones in each world." K 1.29.3
ENERGY, EXCHANGE OF All atoms in all material aggregates receive and in
their turn emit energies.
"The energies coming in from without have their own types and individual characters.
The energies transmitted further always have their individual characters coloured to a
certain degree in the new aggregates they flow through." K 2.13.10
ENVELOPES, MONAD ENVELOPES The consciousness of the monads develops in
envelopes. It is by acquiring consciousness in its envelopes and in the ever higher
molecular kinds of these envelopes that the monad attains ever higher natural kingdoms.
"All forms of nature are envelopes. In every atom, molecule, organism, world, planet,
solar system, etc., there is one monad at a higher stage of development than are the other
monads in this form of nature." K 1.13.1f
"Each envelope of the individual has its consciousness, its memory: the subconscious
collective consciousness of its different molecules." K 1.23.1
"The self develops in and through envelopes, from the lowest physical etheric
envelope to the highest cosmic world. It constantly acquires new envelopes in one world
after another. Step by step it acquires self-consciousness in the ever higher molecular
kinds of its envelope by learning to activate the consciousness in these. By this it
finally becomes master in its envelope. Until then it is disoriented in the consciousness
chaos of this envelope, and it is the victim of vibrations from without." K 1.30.4
EONS The most comprehensive of the solar systemic cycle, 4320 million
years. One eon is equal to a seven-globe period, the time of the monads’ evolution
round the seven globes of the seven-globe. Our seven-globe presently runs through its
fourth eon, the emotional eon (K 2.13.4).
ESOTERICS That knowledge of reality and life from the greatest possible
perspective which can only be communicated to a prepared élite of mankind. Esoterics is
in the possession of the planetary hierarchy and was taught, up to 1875, in its secret
knowledge orders only, after 1875 partially in public. As a rule, only those understand
esoterics who possess the knowledge latently from previous incarnations.
ESOTERICS, BASIC AXIOM OF: "There are laws in everything and
everything is expressive of law." K 4.11.7
ESOTERIC HISTORY BEFORE 1875 "Members of this planetary hierarchy
incarnated in mankind, eventually to make up what in the esoteric history has been called
the ‘higher priesthood’. This happened in Lemuria. As soon as consciousness had
developed sufficiently for men to be able to learn, they were given such necessary
instruction and knowledge of reality as they were able to grasp. In both Lemuria and
Atlantis, temple schools were set up in which the human élite were given the education
suited to their ability to comprehend... The élite were trained to be teachers of the
rest of mankind, eventually to form the ‘lower priesthood’."
Later, a large part of the "lower priesthood", who had acquired a knowledge of
magic, rebelled against the "higher priesthood". The planetary hierarchy was
banished first in Lemuria, later in Atlantis.
"Abuse of knowledge leads to the loss of knowledge, and ever since the planetary
hierarchy was driven out of Atlantis mankind has had to ‘look after its own
affairs’."
"However, not everybody took part in the black priesthood's revolt against the higher
priesthood. Those individuals who had reached the stage of culture, and who were on the
side of good, did not forfeit the right to remember anew their old knowledge. For their
benefit the planetary hierarchy instituted secret knowledge orders among all nations that
had reached such a stage of development that cultural individuals could incarnate among
them."
The planetary hierarchy made two attempts to awaken man to see the rationality of life and
to counteract the dreadful hatred between men… In India Buddha incarnated to try and
impress the people with what has been called the "religion of wisdom". And
Christos incarnated to awaken people to understand what has been called the "religion
of love".
"As we know, both attempts failed. Buddha’s disciples were driven out of India,
and Christos’ message of love was taken care of by individuals who had belonged to
the black priesthood of Atlantis.
"The planetary hierarchy had no other choice but to continue instituting new
knowledge orders, as for the rest trying to vitalize men’s emotional and mental
consciousness, so that these could develop into greater understanding of reality."
By the year 1775 mankind had reaped the last of its bad sowing from Atlantis. "The
knowledge of reality could thus in that respect be permitted to become common
property"... "The problem of how mankind, totally disoriented, was best to
assimilate the knowledge had long been under discussion in the planetary hierarchy, and
vast preparations had been made."
"It was at the conclave of the planetary hierarchy in 1775 that two of its members
(the then 45-selves M. and K.H.) offered to take immediate steps to publicize some part of
the knowledge of the consciousness and matter aspects of existence which hitherto had been
imparted in the esoteric knowledge orders."
"All the other members of the planetary hierarchy voted against the proposal, since
they considered that far too few people had attained the necessary stage of mental
development for the undertaking to have any prospect of success. The emotional illusions
of the prevailing religions and the mental fictions of philosophy were so remote from the
real conception of reality that any attempt to communicate superphysical knowledge to the
so-called educated, either would be rejected out of hand, or would give rise to new
imaginative excesses. They considered that one ought to wait until at least those furthest
developed had acquired physical etheric objective consciousness. Then they would see the
fictitiousness of the prevailing idiologies and prove readier to examine, at least, the
reality content of the esoteric mental system.
"As unanimity could not be reached, the matter was referred to the president of the
government, the planetary ruler, who considered: "as these two brothers of ours have
offered to prepare the spread of the knowledge and have expressed their willingness
themselves to bear the consequences and know what this means, they should be allowed to
make the attempt."
"The time for the publication of the knowledge was fixed for 1875. In the meantime
everything was to be done to raise the general level of education and to spread
literacy." K 3.1.4ff
ESOTERIC HISTORY AFTER 1875 The instrument the planetary hierarchy had
chosen for the task of publicizing the knowledge which had been kept secret since Atlantis
was H. P. Blavatsky (1831-1891). "Blavatsky was enjoined not to give out any esoteric
facts without special permission in each individual case. She was not to mention anything
about the planetary hierarchy."
"The truth, or the knowledge of reality, is only to be given gradually, with sparing
facts, to a mankind unprepared to receive it. It is necessary to find connections to
established fictions of which people have heard enough for them to believe that they
comprehend what it all is about. A new, revolutionary system of ideas would be rejected
off hand as a mere fantastic invention. It could not be comprehended, let alone
understood, without careful preparation.
"The most important reason, which probably only esotericians are able to understand,
is the fact of the dynamic energy of ideas."
"Once the esoteric knowledge was permitted to be published there was no longer any
need of initiation into the old knowledge orders, nobody having been initiated into anyone
of them since 1875. Although those initiated in previous incarnations were not given the
opportunity to revive all their old knowledge, enough was made known, and besides hinted
at, for them to be able to discover the most essential by themselves."
"The most important esoteric facts to be found in the works of Sinnett, Judge, and
Hartmann – who received them from the planetary hierarchy through Blavatsky up to
1891 – are: reincarnation, karma, or the law of sowing and reaping (the law of
reaping), the individual’s pre-existence and post-existence (hence immortality), the
existence of the worlds 45–49, knowledge of the individual’s envelopes in higher
worlds, knowledge orders in times past, and lots of historical facts." K 3.2.1ff
Blavatsky was a causal self. In 1875 she contributed to the founding of the Theosophical
Society, which was intended to become a platform for the esoteric teaching. In 1877
Blavatsky published Isis Unveiled, which in two volumes criticized the dogmas of
science and religion.
"Blavatsky’s second standard work of her vast literary production, The Secret
Doctrine... contains the symbols of ‘Dzyan’ (the oldest of the planetary
hierarchy). It gives an account of the different symbolic presentations of the cosmos and
of the evolution of life as by several knowledge orders, showing how these agree." K
3.3.28ff
"With the death of Blavatsky in 1891, this first phase of the publication of new
esoteric facts ended." "The second phase, which lasted 1894-1920, was
characterized by the close collaboration of two esoteric capacities: Annie Besant
(1847-1933) and C.W. Leadbeater (1847-1934)." Both were causal selves.
Leadbeater "was the foremost systematician and historian of esoterics up to 1920...
Nobody before him has given so many new facts." Of these facts the following are the
most important: "the composition of matter, the difference between atomic and
molecular matter, the seven atomic worlds of the solar system, the molecular worlds of the
planetary system, involutionary matter, the evolution of the natural kingdoms, the
consciousness expansion..., man’s three atomic worlds and five molecular worlds of
man, man’s five material envelopes and consciousness in these, man’s permanent
atoms (the triad), the planetary hierarchy, the division of the planetary hierarchy into
seven departments, the planetary government."
"The third and latest phase of the publication of the esoteric knowledge falls during
1920-1950."... "The planetary hierarchy had appointed a ‘secretary’
who was to be the actual link between the esotericians and the planetary hierarchy, and
had decided that, for the time being at least, new facts were to be imparted only through
him: the 45-self D.K." K 3.2.10ff
The works of D.K., published under the name of Alice A. Bailey, are fundamental importance
for the esoteric teaching of our times. They deepen the teaching previously given,
correcting and amplifying it in many places, and provides much knowledge. Main points in
D.K.’s presentation are: evolution in the solar system as principally a manifestation
of the will and man as a phenomenon of will and energy within it, the seven departments
(types) as the basis of a new psychology, the activation of man’s passive causal
consciousness as the most important feature of both ‘white magic’ and the future
system of education, the significance of Augoeides for man’s evolution,
mankind’s relation to the planetary hierarchy and planetary government, discipleship
and the initiations, the reappearance of the planetary hierarchy in the physical world
(externalization) under the guidance of the world teacher, ‘the new group of world
servers’ which ever more consciously collaborates with the hierarchy’s plan for
the evolution of mankind.
"D.K. points out that the individual has not been given the knowledge to enjoy it
with a pleasant feeling of superiority. It entails responsibility, as does all
knowledge." K 3.9.2
D.K. says expressly that he writes for disciples (individuals at the stage of humanity).
His works cannot be understood without a suitable preparation.
1. The solution of the ‘mystery’ of trinity: the three equivalent aspects of
existence, the essential of the absolute knowledge system, the basis of the philosophy and
science of the future.
2. Matter (the atoms) as the vehicles of consciousness and consciousness development as
the meaning of existence.
3. The self as a monad, a primordial atom. (The ‘selves’ described in the older
esoteric literature are the triads of the monad, its envelopes in higher ever higher
kingdoms. The ‘monad’ of T. and B. is the third triad.)
4. The indication of objective grounds of the different stages of development
5. The formulation of laws of life with particular emphasis on the essential ones for our
times as an introduction to the Aquarian epoch of law.
ESOTERIC WORLD VIEW AND LIFE VIEW "The esoteric world view can
never, of course, be anything else for mankind but a working hypothesis. But the further
mankind develops, the more evident the incomparable superiority of this hypothesis will
become. The causal self is able to ascertain its accordance with facts in the five worlds
of man." K 4.11.8
ESOTERICIAN "The esoterician has once and for all left the world
of illusions and fictions, which mankind prefers living in, to enter into the world of
reality." K 1.43.6
"The mystic thinks that man’s reason cannot explain existence, which, it is
true, it cannot. The esoterician knows this, but then is not content with the ability of
human reason to ascertain superphysical facts, but seeks that higher reason which can
achieve contact with the Platonic world of ideas. Until then, he will accept no other
superphysical facts than those from the planetary hierarchy. Proof that ‘facts’
really are facts he gets from their having their given places in the Pythagorean hylozoic
mental system, and their being the simplest and most general explanations of previously
inexplicable realities." K 3.6.5
"On the whole it can be said that in the conditions prevailing at the present time,
true esotericians do not join any societies, but are to be found outside all kinds of
organizations. They can be recognized by their understanding of all things human, and they
strive after truly human relations between all irrespectively of race, nationality, sex,
religion, politics, and all other things that separate man from man." K 3.7.12
ESSENTIAL CONSCIOUSNESS,
46-CONSCIOUSNESS "The consciousness of the essential envelope is that of unity. The
individual knows that he is his own self having a self-identity that will never be lost,
but also a larger self together with all the monads in the five natural kingdoms and, when
he so desires, he can experience others' consciousness as his own. ‘The
drop-consciousness has become one with the ocean-consciousness.’ ‘The union with
god’ is the self's acquisition of the consciousness of unity."
"The 46-self is omniscient in the worlds 46-49."
"Only essential consciousness can become conscious in the physical, emotional, and
mental atoms. Before it is acquired, subatomic molecular consciousness is the highest kind
of consciousness in the different worlds. After it has acquired these kinds of atomic
consciousness, the monad can identify itself with the total consciousness of these worlds
and their unadulterated memory of past time."
"A suitable term for 46-consciousness is world consciousness." K 1.35.5ff
ESSENTIALIZATION The monad’s acquisition of an envelope of
essential matter (46), in which process it passes from the fourth natural kingdom (the
human kingdom) to the fifth natural kingdom (the essential kingdom). More exactly
expressed this implies that the monad definitively centres itself in the second triad
essential atom and so the causal envelope becomes superfluous and is dissolved.
ESSENTIALITY Synonym of ESSENTIAL CONSCIOUSNESS
ESSENTIAL QUALITIES Twelve qualities, manifestations of causal
consciousness and will, which the monad must acquire 100 per cent in order to pass to the
essential kingdom, the fifth natural kingdom. They sum up all positive human qualities,
also those that are possible only at the stages of humanity and ideality. Their true
content, therefore, is inaccessible to lower consciousness, and information given about
them will unfailingly be emotionalized.
Tentatively, the following symbolical keywords have been used about them: 1) Trust in
life, 2) Trust in self, 3) Obedience to law, 4) Uprightness, 5) Impersonality, 6)
Willingness to sacrifice, 7) Faithfulness, 8) Reticence, 9) Joy in life, 10) Purpose, 11)
Wisdom, 12) Unity. (K 1.34.23, 7.23.3)
ESSENTIAL SELF, 46-SELF Monad having envelope and self-consciousness in
the essential world of the planet (46). The essential self has centred itself in the
second triad essential atom and is a member of the fifth natural kingdom.
"The 46-self is omniscient in the worlds 46-49."
"As an essential self, the individual has to acquire by himself through his own
research complete knowledge of everything of importance in the human worlds (47-49)."
"Essential monads form a collective being of their own having a common total
consciousness.
"The essential self does not need to incarnate further, since he has no more to learn
in the kingdom of man. He often does incarnate, however, in order by all means and by
personal contact to help those preparing for their entrance into this higher
kingdom." K 1.35.8, 10ff
ESSENTIAL WORLD Atomic world 46 in the cosmos and in the planets of the
solar system, molecular world 46:2-7 in the planets.
ETHERIC ENVELOPE, ETHERIC BODY The monad’s envelope of physical
etheric matter (49:2-4). In the mineral kingdom, even the etheric envelope belongs to the
group-soul; in the vegetable, animal, and human kingdoms the monad has an individual
etheric envelope. "Etheric matter encloses every cell of the organism and conveys
those different functional energies which the ancients called vital force." K 4.9.1
ETHERIC WORLD, PHYSICAL ETHERIC WORLD Molecular world, the three higher
molecular kinds (49:2-4) of physical matter.
The physical etheric world can be called the special world of plants as regards
consciousness. (K 1.11.5)
ETHERIZATION That process in the evolution of mankind which has the
final result that the individual dispenses with the organism and the physical etheric
envelope (49:2-4) becomes his lowest envelope. One of the conditions of this is that
etheric sight is has been developed. (K 1.33.6, P 2.36.11)
EVOLUTION When the monads upon the completion of involution have
reached the physical world, 49, evolution begins, which is their return to the highest
cosmic world, 1. Evolution begins in the mineral kingdom of the physical world, continues
through the vegetable, animal, and human kingdoms and then passes to expansion, the
continuation of evolution in higher kingdoms.
Evolution is that process in which the monad’s passive consciousness (acquired in
involution) is activated, that is to say, becomes ever more self-active as a prerequisite
of objective consciousness and later, in the human kingdom, self-consciousness. The monads
in evolution in every kingdom take possession of envelopes of their own, being individual
selves in these. It is only in the human kingdom, however, that the monad becomes
self-conscious. (K 1.33)
Evolution (including expansion) "is divided into five natural kingdoms and seven
divine kingdoms. The planetary worlds contain the natural kingdoms, the solar systemic
worlds the lowest divine kingdom, and the cosmic worlds the remaining six." K 4.5.2
EVOLUTION, HOW IT WORKS "The great cosmic evolution does not work
according to a predetermined plan. Only the final goal is laid down: all monads acquiring
omniscience about the whole cosmos... The evolution itself creates the conditions and
possibilities of its growth. These conditions, however, depend on the individual character
of every being, from atoms to planets, solar systems, etc... The past thereby limits the
possibilities of the future. A rigid plan would set aside the law of freedom, according to
which every monad has the right to the freedom (depending on insight and ability) it has
once acquired and continues to apply lawfully. Evolution feels its way forward along every
conceivable path in order to find the one most purposeful for each and all." K 5.36.6
EVOLVATION See INVOLVATION
EXPANSION is the continuation of evolution in superhuman kingdoms. In
these kingdoms the monad, with its self-identity retained, enters into ever more
comprehensive collective consciousnesses until the goal of all monads has been reached,
the common cosmic total consciousness. (K 2.11.5)
EXTERNALIZATION Since many hundred years, the fifth natural kingdom of
our planet is working on the preparation for its reappearance in the external world. It is
as a step in this process of externalization that the esoteric knowledge has been allowed
for publication. The goal of externalization is that the planetary hierarchy resumes the
guidance of the evolution of mankind. (K 7.15.6)
F
FEELING See EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS
FICTIONS "Mental fictions include all fancies, freaks, guesses,
suppositions, assumptions, etc., as well as the hypotheses and theories of science, all
being mental constructions that do not have all the facts put in their correct
contexts." K 2.18.3
"The content even of élite thinking is for the most part made up of fictions
(conceptions without real correspondences), due to lack of facts about existence. It is
only the facts of esoterics that make it possible to think in accordance with
reality." K 1.20.7
FIFTH HUMAN TYPE "is the scientist, research-worker with a sense
of detail, discoverer, inventor, etc." K 2.7.13
FIFTH NATURAL KINGDOM "The fifth natural kingdom consists partly
of 46-selves (essential selves) with envelopes and consciousness in the planetary
essential world, partly of 45-selves with envelopes and consciousness in the systemic
superessential world." K 1.35.4
FINALITY "It is not true, as the physicalists believe, that
finality in nature is a special case of forces of unconscious matter acting mechanically.
The exact opposite of this is the case: the energies that act mechanically in the solar
system are special cases of those acting purposefully: automatized consciousness robots
achieving the missions suited to them with unerring precision." K 2.16.5
FIRST DIVINE KINGDOM See SIXTH NATURAL
KINGDOM
FIRST HUMAN TYPE "is distinguished by a strong so-called will
which makes the individual suitable as a leader, a real one and one recognized as such by
all." K 2.7.9
FIRST SELF Monad that has self-consciousness in someone of the three
units of the first triad, individual in the fourth natural kingdom. Man is a first self.
First selves are divided into physical selves, emotional selves, and mental selves.
FIRST TRIAD See TRIADS
FOHAT Material energies in worlds 43-49.
FORM "All forms in the whole cosmos, also those in the highest
divine kingdoms, are just envelopes for primordial atoms - the
selves." K 1.16.8
"Form is matter’s mode of existing (and this in all worlds)." K 5.9.28
FORM, LAW OF "When their form is renewed all organisms (plants,
animals, men) get a form of life similar to the previous form, until their consciousness
development requires a specifically different, higher form, a more purposeful possibility
of acquiring increased experience." K 1.31.3
FORMS OF LIFE "All life has a form, from atoms, molecules,
aggregates, to planets, solar systems, and cosmic worlds. These forms are subject to the
law of transformation, are continually being changed, dissolved, and re-formed. The monads
(primordial atoms) make up (as viewed from the physical) and ascending series of ever
higher forms of life, in which lower ones enter into and make up envelopes for higher
ones. The entire cosmos constitutes a series of increasingly more refined forms of life,
serving gradually to furnish the monad consciousness with the ‘organ’ it needs
for its continued development." K 4.4.1
FOURTH HUMAN TYPE "is the one who strives after harmony in all,
the designer, architect, city-planner, artistic constructor, etc., with a pronounced sense
of form and colour." K 2.7.12
FREE MONADS "Those who have attained the highest world have freed
themselves from all involvation in matter and as free monads (primordial atoms) have come
to know themselves as the ultimate selves they have always been. Their auras are like
cosmic giant suns and they radiate energy as the fountainhead of all power.
"They can, if they so wish, withdraw with a collectivity from out of their cosmos and
begin building a new cosmos in the endless chaos of primordial matter." K 1.37.4f
FREEDOM "It has not yet been clearly seen that freedom and power
are the same thing. What distinguishes them is the limits of freedom and power. Freedom
has been thought of as the right to be master of oneself and power as the right to be
master of others.
"Freedom requires not only the right to be oneself, but also the ability to be it.
‘Knowledge is power’ if it gives ability. Unfortunately, there is ability
without knowledge and it is this ability which abuses power.
"Freedom is the right of the individual to think, feel, say, and do as he thinks fit,
within the limits of the equal right of all." K 5.48.2ff
"All power implies abuse of power, at best through ignorance of life. The ideal,
then, will never be achieved. But the degree of abuse will be least when people realize
that power coincides with both freedom and law (without law of freedom), when power is
used primarily to defend freedom." K 5.49.9
FREEDOM, LAW OF "The law of freedom says that every monad is its
own freedom and its own law, that freedom is to be gained by law, that freedom is the
right to individual character and activity within the limits of the equal right of
all." K1.41.8
"Unconscious and, to a still higher degree, conscious encroachment upon the monads'
inalienable, inviolable divine freedom, limited by the equal right of all living beings,
results in the struggle for existence and the cruelty of life." K 4.11.4
G
GLOBE MEMORY Spherical material forms have a collective memory of
everything that has happened to them ever since they came about. The physical, emotional
and mental atomic worlds of the planet are instances of such globe memories.
"After it has acquired these kinds of atomic consciousness, the monad can identify
itself with the total consciousness of these worlds and their unadulterated memory of past
time." K 1.35.9
GLOBE PERIOD The period of the monads’ evolution on someone of the
seven globes of the seven-globe, about 600 million years. The current globe period is the
fourth in the current fourth eon, the emotional eon.
GLOBES "In the cosmic sense, space is always a globe. The cosmos
is a globe. The solar systems are globes. The planets are globes. The worlds in the
planets are globes. The cosmic atomic worlds occupy the same ‘space’ as the
physical world, exist everywhere in the cosmic globe." K 1.8.2
From the viewpoint of consciousness, globes are unitary beings that have collective
consciousness.
GNOMES See NATURE BEING
GNOSTICIANS Members of an esoteric knowledge order, founded in
Alexandria in 300 BC and later extended throughout the whole eastern Mediterranean area.
They possessed gnosis (the knowledge of reality and life) and put it down in a rich
symbolic literature. The central symbol was ‘Christos’, referring to the fifth
natural kingdom, man’s goal. The teaching of the gnosticians was the ‘esoteric
Christianity’, from which the profane Christianity we know arose through distortion.
GOAL OF EXISTENCE See MEANING
AND GOAL OF EXISTENCE
GOOD, THE LAW OF "According to the law of good, man always follows
the highest that he really sees and understands (not merely believes or resolves), because
he cannot do otherwise, because it is for him a need and a joy to do so." K 5.8.28,
(P 3.4.5)
GOOD AND EVIL "All good and evil that befalls the individual is
his own work, the result of his own application of his limited conception of right and
wrong. All reap what they have sown in previous lives and often in the same life. Nothing
can happen to the individual which he has not deserved by defying the Law."
K 1.41.19f (K 4.11.3)
"Good is all that promotes, evil all that counteracts, consciousness development,
individually as well as collectively. To the greatest and the most fatal mistakes that can
be made belongs spreading ignorance's emotional illusions and mental fictions, resulting
in idiotization." K 3.4.20
"For the individual, good is the steps above his level, and particularly the
immediately higher step. Evil is the lower, that which is below his level and, usually, in
particular degree just the one he has recently left. In this is the subjectivity of the
conception of right but not any relativity, which nullifies the necessary opposition
between good and evil." P 3.16.10
GOD This term occurs with esotericians in the following senses:
1. The cosmic total consciousness in which each monad has an inalienable share (god
immanent).
2. The seven ever higher divine kingdoms starting from world 44 (god transcendent).
3. The highest controlling monad (dominant) in some certain collective being: the
‘god’ of a planet, a solar system etc. (K 1.30.5, 1.37)
GOD IMMANENT AND
TRANSCENDENT "In the atoms of all the lower worlds (47-
49) there are essential atoms having passive consciousness, which can be activated by
vibrations from without (god immanent). It is only at the higher emotional stage that the
individual is sufficiently developed to be able to perceive these vibrations some time at
all." K 1.35.6
God immanent is the cosmic total consciousness. (K 2.4)
"’God immanent’ indicates that every monad is a potential god, a god in
becoming (besides, sharing in cosmic ‘divinity’). ’God transcendent’
is all higher, superhuman kingdoms, which cooperate for evolution." K 2.4.6
"Before the monad has attained the highest divine kingdom, it distinguishes between
god immanent and god transcendent. Immanent divinity is always conscious of its unity with
all life. The superconscious belongs to transcendent divinity." K 4.5.4
GODS Individuals that are omniscient and omnipotent in their respective
worlds. They are members of someone of the seven divine kingdoms; the first kingdom in the
solar systemic worlds 43 and 44; the second to the seventh kingdom, in the cosmic worlds 1- 42.
"In their contacts with men, the gods assume human ideal shapes, permanent envelopes
of physical atomic matter, also to anchor their physical consciousness, envelopes which
can easily be made visible to all." (K 1.39.3)
"The gods themselves are subject to the Law. Omnipotence is possible only through
absolutely faultless application of the laws in their entirety." K 1.41.3
"No supreme power can reach that omnipotence of dynamis which is required to produce
primordial atoms in primordial matter. This work can only be done by the dynamic energy of
primordial matter." P 2.52.6
GROUP-SOUL A common envelope for a group of monads in the three lowest
natural kingdoms. The group-soul in the mineral kingdom is three common envelopes of
physical etheric, emotional, and mental matter; in the vegetable kingdom, two common
envelopes of emotional and mental matter; in the animal kingdom one common envelope of
mental matter. At incarnation the animal receives individual envelopes from the group
soul. Experiences had are stored in the individual envelopes. At the end of the
incarnation the borrowed envelopes are dissolved into the group-soul, and the individual
experiences can then be shared by all monads in the group. During incarnation the monad is
in telepathic contact with its group-soul, which fact explains the instinct of the
species. The higher species is in evolution, the fewer individuals go to form its
group-souls.
GUNA (Skt ‘quality’) The three gunas -
sattva (‘rhythm’), rajas (‘mobility’), and tamas (‘inertia’)
- correspond esoterically to material energies from the three
atomic kinds 45, 47, 49. (K 7.2.5)
H
HEART OF THE SUN (B.) The sun in world 46.
HEAVENLY MAN (T.B.) The planetary collective of at least 46-monads (the
planetary hierarchy, the deva hierarchy, the planetary government). In our solar system,
there are ten such collective beings; three greater and seven lesser. Synonyms: Planetary
Logos, Divine Manasaputra.
HIERARCHIC IDEAS "The cosmic ideas pertaining to consciousness
development that are to be realized in the human and lower kingdoms are laid down by the
planetary government and effected by the planetary hierarchy. Ideals can be accepted or
rejected. But hierarchic ideas must be realized, no matter how long it will take.
"Just as mankind has its highest world (the causal world) and from there can bring
down ideas, so the planetary hierarchy has its world of ideas, the lowest world of the
planetary government, world 44." K 2.17.1f
HIERARCHY See PLANETARY HIERARCHY
HIEROPHANT (Gr.) Esoteric teacher at the ancient mysteries.
HOROSCOPE "By horoscope is understood the sum total of
ascertainable celestial relationships to exact time, exact longitude and latitude on our
planet at the ‘birth’ of something. (The monad, or group of monads, in question
thereby enters anew into a causal connection temporarily interrupted. ‘The Law can
wait’.) Thereby one gains knowledge of what principal energies most strongly
influence, say, a person during his lifetime. If one also has knowledge of the
individual's different envelopes and can determine what vibrations will most strongly
influence them, it will be possible to draw a number of important conclusions about the
characteristic problems that this same person will have to wrestle with. But this does not
mean that one can foresee the individual's fate. To do so would eliminate the law of
freedom wholly. Nothing is predestinated in detail. The new esoteric astrology will put a
definite end to fatalism and the doctrine of predestination." K 2.13.12
HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS "During incarnation the normal individual at
mankind's present stage of development is as a rule objectively conscious in his organism
only, subjectively conscious in his etheric, emotional, and mental envelopes, and
unconscious in his causal envelope. ‘Visible’ physical reality, comprising the
three lowest physical states of aggregation (solid, liquid, and gaseous), is the only one
man knows anything about and that which he considers to be the only one existing. He
regards his desires and feelings in his emotional envelope and his thinking in his mental
envelope as something subjective only, not understanding that these phenomena objectively
correspond to vibrations in the kinds of matter of the respective worlds." K 4.10.1
HUMAN EVOLUTION The parallel evolution leading the monad from the
mineral kingdom to the human kingdom and beyond this to expansion beings having tasks that
especially concern consciousness development. The human evolution exists on all the ten
planets of our solar system, but it is only on Terra that it invests its monads with
organisms in the vegetable, animal, and human kingdoms.
HUMAN INDIVIDUAL, HISTORY OF "The history of the human individual
exists in the collective memory of the causal world (47)." K 2.17.4
HUMAN KINGDOM
"The consciousness development in the human kingdom can be divided into five
principal stages comprising a total of 777 levels of development. The table below shows
which molecular consciousnesses are thereby activated.

K 1.34.4f
HUMAN MONAD The monad during its evolution in the human kingdom is
called human monad.
HUMANIST Man at the higher mental stage, or the stage of humanity.
HUMANITY, STAGE OF The fourth of man’s five stages of development.
"The most distinguishing trait of the humanist is his striving after common sense, a
prerequisite for acquiring causal intuition. He can no longer, like the mystic, lose
himself in the ineffable, but demands above all clarity in everything and facts for
everything. His firm determination to comprehend reality and life despite everything
compels him always to seek further... When he has come to the Sokratean realization that
man cannot know anything worth knowing, he is ready to receive the esoteric knowledge.
"In the old days, he would then have been chosen to be initiated into some secret
knowledge order. Nowadays he is given the knowledge in a mental system of the fundamental
facts of existence, which his reason compels him to accept as the only tenable working
hypothesis." K 1.34.19f
HYLOZOICS (Gr. hyle, ‘matter’, and zoe, ‘life’)
‘Spiritual materialism’ or the doctrine that matter is the necessary basis of
all consciousness. The system of esoteric knowledge formulated by the then 46-self
Pythagoras was intended to form the basis of the science of the future. In advance of
other esoteric systems, hylozoics is characterized by the fact that it alone explains that
existence is a trinity of matter, motion, and consciousness; it alone explains that
consciousness is a quality of matter and so doing clears away subjectivism and
illusionism; it alone has abstained from vague symbolism and has instead strived after
scientific exactitude and unambiguous terminology. In order to achieve this exactitude
hylozoics in its explanations starts from the matter aspect.
The modern formulation of hylozoics was presented by Henry T. Laurency in The
Philosopher’s Stone in 1950 and contains as essential elements the following
doctrines: the self is a primordial atom (monad), all the forms of nature are envelopes
for monads, all consciousness (also the highest cosmic consciousness) is product of an
evolution that pervades everything in the cosmos, there are seven basic laws of life, and
mankind (every human individual) goes through five chief stages of development. (K 1.4,
5.3f, 7.2)
I
IDEAL "The purposeful ideal is always the next higher stage of
development. Ideals that cannot be realized become set phrases and fair promises, which
nobody takes seriously and which but enhance self-deception. The ideal of the stage of
civilization is culture, but true culture, not that masked barbarism which is called
culture." P 3.22.8
IDEALIST Man at the causal stage, or the stage of ideality.
IDEALITY, STAGE OF The highest of man’s five stages of
development. At the stage of humanity, man can, in the proper sense, understand esoterics.
At the stage of ideality, he uses the insight he has gained to activate his hitherto
passive causal consciousness (47:2,3). So doing he can ascertain facts about reality in
the three worlds of man (47- 49) and study his previous
incarnations in the human kingdom.
"As a causal self he acquires knowledge of the laws of life and the ability to make
rational use of this knowledge with one-pointed purpose." K 1.34.22
"He enters into communication with those in higher kingdoms and receives from them
the further facts he needs but cannot ascertain for himself. He gradually acquires the
twelve essential qualities that make it possible for him to pass to the fifth natural
kingdom." K 1.34.23
IDEAS "There are cosmic ideas, systemic ideas, planetary ideas, as
many different kinds of ideas as there are kinds of atomic consciousness and atomic worlds
in the cosmos.
"It is our planetary government that is entrusted with the cosmic ideas pertaining to
the maintenance and development of the life in the planet and which also sees to it that
they are realized in accordance with the laws.
"These ideas are the causes of the processes in nature, the causes of the formation,
changes, and dissolution of matter, and they are the preconditions of the consciousness
development of all the natural kingdoms." K 2.16.2ff
IDEAS, DYNAMIC ENERGY OF "Every idea is a mental atom charged with
energy. If these succeed in penetrating into brain-cells that are receptive, yet not
previously vitalized by similar mental molecules, they can have an adverse effect on the
balance of people’s minds. Imparting a whole system could cause mental chaos. The
fact that people will instinctively fend off too revolutionary ideas is often a natural
measure of self-protection." K 3.2.3
IDEAS, SCALING DOWN OF "When the causal ideas of intuition are
mentalized into mental concepts, these ideas become ideals for reason, and when these
ideals are emotionalized, they become dogmas for emotional thinking. But when the ideas
have thus been twice scaled down, their relative validity has been made absolute and thus
they have become inimical to life." K 5.8.19
IDEAS, WORLD OF = PLATONIC WORLD OF IDEAS is the causal world (47:1-3),
the goal of man in the human kingdom. (K 1.11.5)
IDEAS OF THE CAUSAL WORLD
"The ideas of the world of ideas are objective forms as well as being subjective, and
thus the ideas are faithful representations of enduring objective and subjective
realities. Every intuition corresponds to a mental system of reality ideas. Lower worlds
exist in the ideas of the world of ideas and thus the knowledge of these lower worlds is
contained in the idea systems of the intuitions. ‘Beholding the ideas in the world of
ideas’ meant experiencing the reality content, with all its relationships, of the
knowledge system inherent in the causal idea.
"The world of ideas is, among many other things, the unadulterated memory of all past
events in the physical, emotional, and mental worlds ever since the planet came into
being. The subjective consciousness content of these ideas gives us exact knowledge of
reality without possibility of mistake, fictionalism, or deception. They also constitute
our ideals, since they explain the ends and the ways of their realization. The forms in
the world of ideas are the perfect forms of beauty." K 5.8.17f
"Platon’s ideas are living forces, causal elementals with ideas charged with
energy." K 5.33.7
IDENTIFICATION "Since man tends always to identify his self (his
monad, ultimate self) with that envelope in which he happens for the time to be, he
regards himself in the physical world as being a physical self, in the emotional world as
an emotional self, in the mental world as a mental self, and in the causal world as a
causal self - not seeing that he is a monad, an ultimate
self." K 1.14.7
"When the monad has gone through involution and evolution of the process of
manifestation, acquired and discarded envelope after envelope in world after world, and,
finally, in the highest cosmic world, has freed itself from its involvation into matter,
it becomes conscious of itself as a monad. Until then it will identify itself with one or
another of the envelopes which it has acquired and activated." K 4.6.2
IDIOLOGY The constructions of life-ignorance, from idios,
‘one’s own’, and logos, ‘teaching’; in contrast to ideology based
on Platonic ideas, reality ideas. (K 3.1.17)
IDIOTIZATION Substitution of the mental fictions and emotional
illusions of ignorance for generally valid, objective perception of reality.
ILLUMINATION See ACTIVATION
OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SYSTEMATIC
ILLUSIONIST PHILOSOPHY "In each world the monad consciousness
apprehends reality totally differently. This is what was originally meant by the saying
that all apprehension of reality is maya, or ‘illusion’, since there is no
common apprehension that is universally valid until in the highest cosmic world." K
4.7.2
"Consciousness cannot exist without a material basis. The importance of the
consciousness aspect increases with each higher material world and the importance of the
matter aspect decreases. But it is a mistake to deny the absolute existence of the matter
aspect and an even greater one to disregard its significance in the worlds of man. The
illusionist philosophy of Shankara is a mental fiction in the world of emotional
illusions." K 7.2.17
ILLUSIONS "Emotional illusions are emotionalized mental
conceptions, which, on account of emotional needs, have turned into permanent convictions
(dogmas, beliefs). Examples include all political idiologies and religious dogmas." K
2.18.2
"The individual is completely free of the illusions only after he has acquired causal
consciousness." K 1.19.4
IMAGINATION See EMOTIONAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
IMMANENT Indwelling. Immanent divinity, see GOD IMMANENT AND TRANSCENDENT
IMPULSE Reception of consciousness content from the subconscious (K
1.22.5)
INCARNATION After the end of his incarnation and the dissolution of his
envelopes of incarnation, "the individual in his causal envelope sinks into dreamless
sleep that will last until the time comes for rebirth and an embryo has been formed for
him in a physical maternal body. He awakens with a desire for a new life and forms
instinctively, by means of his causal envelope, new mental and emotional envelopes, these
being the necessary communication links. It will be the task of the growing child to use
its latent qualities to develop the ability of consciousness in them." K 1.34.34
INCARNATION, ENVELOPES OF Man’s envelopes of incarnation are the
envelopes that dissolve at the end of each incarnation and are formed again at the
beginning of each incarnation: the mental, emotional, and etheric envelopes and the
organism. It is the causal envelope that incarnates together with the monad, which it
always encloses. (K 1.34.34)
INCARNATIONS, NUMBER OF "in each natural kingdom is unlimited,
until the individual will have acquired the qualities and abilities requisite in the
respective kingdoms, and an envelope of his own in the next higher world." K 4.10.4
INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER "It is important for scientists of all kinds
to understand that everything has an individual character. Every primordial atom (monad)
is something unique. Every combination of monads of whatever kind is something unique.
Every change (because of continual exchange of atoms in the aggregate) is unique." K
2.8.6
"Uniformity is out of the question. Everything that exists is individual and unique
and, once it has acquired the consciousness of unity, constitutes an ever-welcome
contribution to the greater fullness of vibrant cosmic harmony." K 2.7.18 (K 2.5.9)
INDIVIDUALIZATION (T.B.) Older term of causalization.
INDRA (Skt, T.B.) Devaraja of world 46.
INDUCTION Scientific procedure of concluding general laws or conditions
from particular cases. Opposite. deduction. (K 5.17.8)
INFERENCE THINKING The majority of mankind has developed (activated)
only the lowest kind of mental consciousness (47:7): discursive inference thinking from
ground to consequence. (K 1.20.3)
INITIATION Process in esoteric training where the disciple (his monad)
under the guidance of his teacher (a member of a higher natural kingdom) breaks through to
the consciousness and energy (‘will’) of a higher atomic kind and definitively
conquers it. The condition of this is the self-acquisition of all the necessary qualities
and abilities up to initiation. The first initiation concerns atomic kind 49; the second,
48; the third, 47; the fourth, 46; the fifth, 45; the sixth, 44; the seventh 43; the
eighth, 42; and the ninth, 36. This is the general principle. In actual fact, the three
lowest kinds of atomic consciousness are only acquired in connection with the fourth
initiation. Therefore, the first three initiations concern consciousness in 49:2, 48:2,
and 47:2, respectively. (K 6.12.21ff)
INNER ROUND (T.B.) The activity of life within a seven-globe is
concentrated almost entirely to one of the seven globes in turn. However, there are in the
six other globes small nuclei of monads belonging to all the natural kingdoms, monads who
in the evolution have either lagged behind or overtaken the main body. These separate
evolutions are called by a common term the ‘inner round’.
INSPIRATION Reception of consciousness content from the superconscious.
(K 1.22.5)
INTUITION Refers to at least causal consciousness (47:1-3). Ignorance
has idiotized this originally esoteric term so as to denote emotional impulses with a
faint content of the lowest mental consciousness (47:7).
"It is intuition that opens up the world of ideas for us. It is a special organ of
knowledge that gives us correct ideas, correct knowledge of reality. Only a few men have
worked their way up through the different ‘layers of consciousness’ of the
mental world and succeeded in the conquest of the consciousness of intuition. Even most
philosophers are still in the two lowest domains of deductive thinking and principle
thinking, respectively. One cannot speak of true intuition until the individual has
acquired and mastered perspective thinking and system thinking." K 5.36.7 (K 7.5)
INTUITION (T.B.) Has reference to two different kinds of consciousness:
1. Causal consciousness (47:1-3)
2. Essential consciousness (46:1-7) (K 7.5.5)
INVOLUTION is a second involvation that previously involved monads
undergo in the atomic and molecular matter of the solar system (43-
49). (In contrast, involvation occurs in all the cosmic worlds 1-
49). Involution makes possible the building of aggregate envelopes and the actualization
of the potential consciousness of the monads. Involutionary beings are called elementals.
The process of involution goes from a higher world to a lower world; its goal is the
physical world, where evolution begins. (K 2.11.3F, 4.3)
INVOLUTIONARY MATTER See SECONDARY MATTER
INVOLVATION means in hylozoics:
1. Composition of higher matter to form lower matter.
2. Incarnation, attachment of higher envelopes to lower envelopes.
"All matter (atomic kinds, molecular kinds, aggregates, worlds,
etc.) is formed and dissolved. Only primordial atoms are eternal and indestructible. The
process of composition to make lower kinds of matter is called involvation and the
corresponding process of dissolution, evolvation. The lower the kind of matter, the more
involved are the primordial atoms." K 1.7.3
INVOLVATIONAL MATTER See PRIMARY MATTER
J
JIVA, JIVATMA (Skt, T.B.) The monad, the abiding self in all forms.
JOY "Life is joy, happiness, bliss in the mental and all higher
worlds. Suffering is found only in the three lower regions of the physical and emotional
worlds." K 1.41.18
K
KALPA (Skt, T.B.) Period of 4320 million years. Is called eon in
hylozoics.
KAMA (Skt, T.B.) Emotional consciousness.
KARMA (Skt, T.B.) means:
1. The law of sowing and reaping, the law of reaping.
2. Effects according to this law: the reaping (good or bad ‘karma’)
KNOWLEDGE "Knowledge is a perfect thought system of the necessary
facts. It is only the planetary hierarchy that can decide whether all the facts are
there." K 2.18.4
"Knowledge of reality consists in a system of subjective reality concepts, based on
and agreeing with the facts of objective material reality. When these facts have been
ascertained and placed in their correct relationships (historical, logical, psychological,
and causal), man will have true knowledge of reality." K 5.38.3
KNOWLEDGE, HYLOZOIC THEORY OF "As regards the theory of knowledge,
everything is above all what it appears to be: physical material reality, but beside that
always something totally different and immensely more." K 1.4.3, 4.1.1
"In the main, there are three totally different kinds of so-called theory of
knowledge; that of Western ignorance of life, Indian illusionist philosophy (advaita), and
hylozoics, respectively.
"The Western theory is either the usual agnostic or skeptical physicalism that denies
the existence of anything that cannot be ascertained by everybody, and regards
consciousness as a quality of organic matter; or philosophic subjectivism that attributes
man's different kinds of consciousness to a fictitious "immaterial" or
"spiritual" world of consciousness.
"The advaita philosophy makes the cardinal mistake of judging reality in one world
from the apprehension of reality in another world, and therefore arrives at nothing but
absurdities. The apprehension of reality in world 45, for example, is logically impossible
to both 47- selves and 43-selves. The philosophers must learn to let ‘this be
this’ in every world. K 7.2.11ff
"Hylozoics maintains that every world is its own inevitable reality, just as real as
is the reality of all other worlds to those who are in it. The three aspects of reality
not only seem different but are different in the different worlds." K 7.2.15
KNOWLEDGE, SUPERPHYSICAL "It is not correct to say, as Blavatsky
did, that all superphysical knowledge has come from ‘India’. It has come from
the planetary hierarchy, and its esoteric knowledge orders have existed among all nations
that have attained a sufficiently high level to be able to inquire intelligently into the
meaning and goal of life." K 1.43.5
KNOWLEDGE ORDERS, ESOTERIC Secret schools of knowledge founded by
members of the planetary hierarchy, who are at least 46-selves. The first one was founded
by Vyasa about 45 000 years ago. After 1875 the knowledge orders of the planetary
hierarchy are closed and so no new members have been initiated into them. (K 1.1.16, 1.2,
3.1, 3.2.5)
KSHITI (Skt, T.B.) Devaraja of world 49.
KUNDALINI (Skt the ‘coiling one’, T.B.) The energy in the
basal centre of the etheric envelope, an energy which strives to unite with that in the
crown centre. Originates ultimately from the cosmic worlds 29-
35. Synonym: serpent fire. (K 7.12.9)
L
LATENT CONSCIOUSNESS Kind or degree of consciousness that the monad has
once attained but then lost although with a possibility of resuscitation. All acquired
qualities and abilities remain latent in a new incarnation, if they are not given
opportunities to develop, which is done with ever-increasing ease, however. Usually, only
understanding is actual.
LAW, THE "The Law is the sum total of all the laws of nature and
life: the constant relationships of matter, motion, and consciousness, expressive of the
nature of primordial matter and of omnipotent, inexhaustible, eternally dynamic primordial
force, acting in its blind way in the imperturbable and inevitable constant relationships
of nature and life.
"Of this Law, science has not yet explored more than an infinitesimal fraction.
"There are laws in everything and everything is expressive of law. The gods
themselves are subject to the Law. Omnipotence is possible only through absolutely
faultless application of the laws in their entirety.
"In primordial matter (the chaos of the ancients) there are no laws manifest. They
only appear in connection with the composition of the atoms in the cosmos.
"The further the limits of subjective and objective consciousness are extended, the
more laws are discovered. Only the monads of the highest divine kingdom have knowledge of
all the laws of the universe and are able to apply them correctly with unfailing
precision.
"Laws of nature concern matter and motion and laws to life concern the consciousness
aspect." K 1.41.1ff
LAW OF NATURE "Laws of nature concern matter and motion and laws f
life concern the consciousness aspect." K 1.41.6
LAWS OF LIFE "Laws of nature concern matter and motion, and laws
of life concern the consciousness aspect.
"The laws of life most important to mankind are the laws of freedom, unity,
development, self (self-realization), destiny, reaping, and activation."
"Those most important for the individual are: the laws of freedom, unity, self, and
activation - especially the first two."
"The laws of life make possible the greatest possible freedom and unerring justice
for all. Freedom, or power, is the individual’s divine, inalienable right. It is
acquired through knowledge of the Law and through unfailing application of the laws.
Freedom (power) and law are the conditions of each other. Development implies purposefully
applied activity in accordance with the Law. Otherwise the cosmos would degenerate into
chaos." K 1.41.15f
LEARNING Systematized data which need not agree with reality, however;
in contradistinction to knowledge, which is facts about reality put into a system.
LEMURIA Hemispherical continent and abode of the third root-race. It
was situated in the present Pacific and was submerged into the ocean about four million
years ago.
"The Lemurians led a half-dreamlike life of consciousness on the border between the
physical and the emotional. It took millions of years to mentalize the brain." K
6.5.6
LIBERATION "Esoterically, the self’s evolution is a
continuous process of identification and liberation." K 7.15.10
LIFE BETWEEN INCARNATIONS, HUMAN "When the individual leaves his
worn-out organism with its etheric envelope, he goes on living in his emotional envelope
and, when this is dissolved, in his mental envelope, and when this too is dissolved, he
waits, asleep in his causal envelope, to be reborn into the physical world which is
incomparably the most important, since it is in this world that all human qualities must
be acquired, and it is only in this world that he has the possibility of freeing himself
from emotional illusions and mental fictions. Life between incarnations is a period of
rest in which man does not learn anything new. The more quickly the self can free itself
from its incarnation envelopes, the more quickly it develops." K 1.34.25
LIFE VIEW "The life view concerns the consciousness aspect of
existence and is the sum total of man's attitude to life, to its meaning and goal, and his
view of mankind and man’s ways."
"It is from his life view that man derives the bases of his valuations, his
viewpoints for judgement, motives for action. The life view includes the conception of
right and what is contained in the concept of culture." P 3.1.1f
The esoteric life view presented in P "is termed esoteric since it is based on the
esoteric world view and on esoteric facts about the goal of life. There is no such life
view that suits all on all levels of development. What in common to them all is the
knowledge of the laws of life, which everybody applies according to his understanding of
life." P 3.1.5
"All who have reached the stages of culture and humanity, have emphasized that in
one’s attitude to all people, universal good will and right human relations are the
essential thing. We must learn to discard all pretexts for friction, not only tolerate but
rejoice in the individual (and independent!) conceptions of all as proof of their own
judgement at their level." K 5.44.2
LINGA SHARIRA (Skt, T.) The etheric envelope.
LOGOI Collective beings of second, third selves, etc. The planetary
logos is the planet’s collective being composed of at least 46-selves (planetary
hierarchy, deva hierarchy, planetary government). The solar logos is the corresponding
being of the entire solar system.
LOVE, HUMAN "Human love is attraction (physical, emotional, and
mental). Regrettably, it can turn into repulsion if it is not genuine." K 1.35.17
LOVE-WISDOM Older esoteric term of essential consciousness (46). (K
1.35.16)
LUNAR LORDS (T.B.), or LUNAR PITRIS (T.B.) those human monads were
called who became second selves in the seven-globe preceding our present one. Certain
groups of these (lunar pitris, barhishad pitris) were charged with the task of designing
the prototypes of man’s envelopes of incarnation (mental, emotional, etheric
envelopes and organism) in our seven-globe. Therefore, these lower envelopes are called
‘lunar bodies’ in old esoteric literature, in contrast to the causal envelope
(‘solar body’).
M
MAGIC The expressions of active consciousness affect matter to act as
energy. Magic consists in using the knowledge of the pertaining laws of nature and the
method of their application affecting physical-etheric material energies by means of
mental material energy to bring about changes in the visible molecular kinds. (K 1.3.9,
1.28.3)
MAHAPARANIRVANA (Skt, T.) World 43, the manifestal world, in the solar
system.
MAHATMA (Skt ‘great spirit’) Esoteric master, perfected
45-self, initiate of the fifth degree.
MANAS (Skt, T.B.) World 47 (causal-mental world) and its consciousness.
Higher manas is 47:1-3, causality; lower manas is 47:4-7, mentality in the proper sense.
Cosmic manas is worlds 29- 35.
MANASA-DEVA Mental or causal deva. Often also denotes essential devas
(the Augoeides).
MANASA-PUTRA (Skt, ‘son of mind’) A general designation of an
individual in a superhuman natural kingdom. Such a one is always a member of some
expanding collective being.
MANIFESTAL SELF, 43-SELF Monad that has its highest envelope and
consciousness in the manifestal world (43) of the solar system.
MANIFESTAL WORLD Atomic world 43 in the cosmos and in the solar system.
Molecular world 43:2-7 in the solar system.
MANIFESTATION, THE ORIGIN OF "All events, all processes of nature,
the formation, changes, and dissolution of matter, in the last resort originate in the
seven highest cosmic worlds. They thus constitute the basis of the motion aspect of
existence." K 2.11.9
MANIFESTATION, THE PLAN OF "The entire process of manifestation is
based on a plan broadly outlined in which the final goal (the omniscience of all
participating monads) alone is fixed. The process depends in its course more or less on
the cooperation of all monads. They cannot, of course, prevent the process being
completed, but resistance or inertia on their part can delay it." K 2.11.8
MANIFESTATION, PROCESS OF The process of manifestation consists of: the
process of involvation and evolvation, the process of involution and evolution, the
process of expansion.
The process of manifestation is the process in which the cosmos is formed, maintained,
developed, and finally dissolved. (K 2.11)
"The entire cosmos constitutes one continuous process of manifestation in which all
monads participate with their consciousness manifestations, consciously or unconsciously,
intentionally or unintentionally. The higher the world or kingdom, the higher the kind of
consciousness, the greater is the monad's contribution to the process of
manifestation." K 4.6.1
In the process of manifestation, the monads are at first primary matter devoid of
consciousness, are subsequently involved to form secondary matter, forming out of it
aggregates (elementals) with passive consciousness. After their transition to evolution
the monads are at first tertiary matter with faint self-active consciousness. Finally the
monads become quaternary matter with sufficiently self-active consciousness to be able to
involve into envelopes and become the selves in these.
MANIFESTATIONAL MATTER Atomic matter of kinds 1-
49 in the cosmos.
MANIPURA-CHAKRA (Skt) The solar plexus centre; also called the navel
centre.
MANKIND, GENERAL DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE OF The stage at which the majority
of presently incarnated people are found. Where their feeling life is concerned, they are
still found in the spheres of repulsive emotionality. At that stage, reason is of
secondary importance, often a difficult source of unrest. These people take their feelings
to be their true being. (K 5.45.11)
MANKIND OF OUR PLANET "The number of individuals counted among our
planet's mankind, causalized here or transferred hither, amounts to some 60 thousand
million. They are in the physical, emotional, mental, and causal worlds of our planet,
most of them asleep in their causal envelopes - since they have
no possibility of causal consciousness - pending a new
incarnation." K 1.34.7
"Of these, some 24 billion causalized (transmigrated from the animal to the human
kingdom by acquiring causal envelopes of their own) in Lemuria, beginning in the year
21,686,420 B.C. The other 36 billion have been transferred to our planet at different
turns. The causal envelopes of the latter are of very different ages. This explains why
the individuals in mankind are at such widely different stages of development, and how it
is that many have now passed to higher kingdoms.
"Most generally, one can say that mankind’s present physical consciousness was
developed in Lemuria, its emotional consciousness in Atlantis, and its mental
consciousness in the continents we know of. We have a long way to go, however, before we
develop full physical, emotional, and mental consciousness in our physical etheric,
emotional, and mental envelopes. When this has been done and we have acquired full
objective consciousness in our causal envelope, we shall pass to the fifth natural
kingdom" K 3.1.2f
MAN’S FIVE ENVELOPES "Man, incarnated in the physical world,
has five envelopes:
an organism in the visible world (49:5-7)
an envelope of physical etheric matter (49:2-4)
an envelope of emotional matter (48:2-7)
an envelope of mental matter (47:4-7)
an envelope of causal matter (47:1-3)
The four lower of these are renewed at each new incarnation and are
dissolved in their order at the end of incarnation. The causal envelope is man’s only
permanent envelope." K 1.14.1f
"The four aggregate envelopes are oval in shape and extend between 30 and 45 cm
beyond the organism, making the so-called aura." K 1.14.4
Each aggregate envelope makes its particular kind of consciousness possible. It is the
presence of these envelopes in the organism that enables man in physical incarnation to
have sense perceptions, feelings, and thoughts at all. (K 1.14.5)
MANTRA "Mantra yoga was originally based on the esoteric knowledge
of the effect of sound. Most mantras (combinations of words) have become worthless now
that the knowledge of correct intonation has been lost, fortunately for mankind." K
7.12.8
MANU (Skt) The chief of the first department (transformation
department) of the planetary hierarchy. K 3.1.28)
MANVANTARA (Skt) Period of activity. Opposite: Pralaya.
MASS THINKING "Human thinking is largely mass thinking: group,
clan, class, or nation thinking, of which man takes part without knowing to, imagining
that he is thinking ‘independently’, unaware where it all comes from." K
2.9.9
MASTER (T.B.) 45-self, initiate of the fifth degree.
MATERIAL ENERGY One of the three specifically different main kinds of
causes of motion. The two others are dynamis and will.
MATERIAL WORLDS, COSMIC; ATOMIC WORLDS, COSMIC
"A fully built out cosmos, such as ours, consists of a continuous series of material
worlds of different degrees of density, the higher penetrating all the lower. The highest
world thus penetrates everything in the cosmos."´
"There are seven series of seven cosmic material worlds, making 49 in all." K
1.6.2,4
The numeration of the worlds is done from the highest world as the first one. This
indicates that they are formed from above, are built out from the highest world down. The
next higher world affords material to the next lower, which is formed in and out of the
higher world. (K 1.6.3,6)
"All the 49 worlds differ from each other as to dimension, duration, material
composition, motion, and consciousness; due to differences in density of primordial
atoms." K 1.6.7
"’Higher’ and ‘lower’ are not to be taken in their spatial
significance when referring to atomic worlds." K 1.8.2
"Each next higher world presents, as compared with each next lower world, an enormous
increase, intensively as well as extensively, in respect of energy and consciousness. In
each world the monad consciousness apprehends reality totally differently."
K 4.7.2
MATERIALISM The view that matter is the fundamental reality. A more
restricted variety of materialism is physicalism.
"Materialism is the only one of the different metaphysical views that it has been
possible to confirm scientifically. The atomic theory can no longer be included in
‘metaphysics’, as it has been traditionally, now that research has so splendidly
confirmed this fundamental esoteric fact: all material forms consist of material
particles. Materialism is the history of philosophy has represented the sovereign common
sense conception of reality asserting the existence of an objectively enduring external
world. The subjectivist theories that deny the existence of the external world refute
themselves by having to admit the existence of matter as soon as they are to explain
natural phenomena." K 5.10.3
Materialism, however, cannot explain the origin of consciousness, its unity, its ability
to affect matter; cannot explain the causes of events or of self-initiated thinking. (K
5.11.12, P 2.2.6)
MAYA (Skt) Illusion. Particularly in the sense that the perception of
reality is supposed to be illusory because matter would not be real. The doctrine of maya
is not part of esoterics but is a misconception of esoteric teaching. (K 4.7.2, 7.2.13f; P
2.62.7ff)
MEANING AND GOAL OF
EXISTENCE "The meaning of existence (a problem unsolvable to theologians,
philosophers, and scientists) is the consciousness development of the primordial atoms, to
awaken to consciousness primordial atoms which are unconscious in primordial matter, and
thereupon to teach them in ever higher kingdoms to acquire consciousness of, understanding
of life in all its relationships.
"The goal of existence is the omniscience and omnipotence of all in the whole cosmos.
"The process implies development: in respect of knowledge from ignorance to
omniscience, in respect of will from impotence to omnipotence, in respect of freedom from
bondage to that power which the application of the laws afford, in respect of life from
isolation to unity with all life." K 1.30.1ff
MEDITATION "By meditating daily on desirable qualities man can
acquire these in any percentage whatever. He will free himself of undesirable qualities by
not attending to them and by meditating on their opposites. He will attain higher levels
by meditating on the qualities of these higher levels. Without meditation, development is
so slow that even after a hundred incarnations there is scarcely any noticeable
progress." K 7.23.2
MEDIUM A person who, in a state of trance, is able to lend his organism
with its etheric envelope to discarnate (‘dead’) people in the emotional world.
Genuine esoteric teachers (members of the planetary hierarchy) never use mediums to
contact people. Quite the opposite, they warn against mediumism, which not only conflicts
with the law of self-realization but also harms the medium physically and
‘morally’. (K 3.1.31ff)
MEMORIES "All matter has consciousness and memory. In addition,
every atom in the molecules has a common collective consciousness with the atoms in its
molecular kind. It is in this collective consciousness that the different worlds have
their respective collective memories, which can be read by those who have acquired
objective consciousness in the respective molecular kinds. In the emotional world there
is, beside the only exact collective memory (inaccessible to man) of the atomic world, six
different kinds of collective molecular memories." K 6.9.2
MEMORY "Each envelope of the individual has its consciousness, its
memory: the subconscious collective consciousness of its different molecules."
"The primordial atom’s memory is indestructible though latent. In order to
remember anew it is necessary to renew the contact with previously experienced reality.
Causal selves and higher selves are able to do this in the planetary and cosmic globe
memories." K 1.23.1,4
"The causal envelope, however, retains the memory of all the human incarnations and
of the experiences had, of insight and understanding gained, of qualities and abilities
acquired. Everything is there as rudiments in new incarnations. How much, or rather, how
little of it all will be actualized anew depends on the individual’s new
opportunities of remembering anew and developing his latent qualities." K 1.34.35
MENTAL-CAUSAL CONSCIOUSNESS Mental-causal consciousness is the
monad’s consciousness in the mental envelope (47:4-7) and in the causal envelope
(47:1-3).
MENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS Mental consciousness is the monad’s
self-acquired ability of consciousness in the mental envelope (47:4-7)
"The majority of mankind have developed (activated) only the lowest kind (47:7):
discursive deductive thinking from ground to consequence.
"The second kind from below (47:6), philosophic and scientific principle thinking, is
still the highest kind of thinking for all except the very rare élite.
"The third kind from below (47:5), élite thinking, is -
in contrast to principle thinking which mostly absolutifies -
partly consistent relativizing and percentualizing thinking, partly perspective thinking
and system thinking.
"The highest kind of consciousness in the mental envelope (47:4) is still
inaccessible to mankind. Its manifestations consist in - among
other things - concretization of causal ideas involving
simultaneous thinking by systems instead of concepts." K 1.20.3ff
MENTAL CULTURE "The prerequisite of the stage of intellectual
culture is a rational and non-contradictory world view and life view, which is free of
dogmas and has been made available for all. This presupposes a system of education that
develops the power of judgement." P 1.1.13
"Mental culture presupposes mental self-reliance and mental self-determination.
Intellectual independence implies the ability critically to sift the material which
culture has afforded us, to judge the kind of certainty and degree of probability accruing
to the ideas we find." P 1.1.15
MENTAL ENVELOPE The monad’s envelope of mental matter (47:4-7). In
the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms the mental envelope belongs to the group-soul;
in the human kingdom, the monad has an individual mental envelope. The mental envelope is
the seat of the power to think. In the human kingdom, the mental envelope is activated
through the emotional envelope, which has the result that the two envelopes are woven
together and form one envelope, which explains why the normal individual has such
difficulty in thinking independently of emotion.
MENTAL LIBERATION FROM EMOTIONALITY "During incarnation the
emotional and mental envelopes coalesce so as to form, as it were, one single envelope
from the functional point of view. Since the emotional is incomparably more developed, it
completely dominates the mental. A prerequisite of liberating the mental from the
dependence on the emotional is that the coalescence be discontinued. This also results in
mental objective consciousness. The method will remain esoteric until mankind has become
humanized. Until then, the lowest mental (47:7) can at best dominate the two lowest
emotional ones (48:6,7) and the two lowest mental ones (47:6,7) the four lower emotional
(48:4-7)." K 6.8.8
From this it follows that only 47:5, perspective thinking, can control the higher
emotionality (48:2,3). This explains why the great majority of people have difficulty in
discovering the untenability of fictions that appeal to wishful thinking.
MENTAL LIFE BETWEEN INCARNATIONS "Upon the dissolution of the
emotional envelope, the individual in his mental envelope leads a life of thought that is
absolutely subjective, not suspecting the impossibility of apprehending objective reality
in this world. But apprehension of reality, bliss, and perfection, omniscience and
omnipotence are absolute."
"The independent life of the mental envelope can vary from a minute or so (in the
case of the barbarian) to thousands of years. It all depends on the number of ideas the
individual has collected during physical life and how vital they are." K 1.34.32f
"It is significant that it is precisely those who have had a long sojourn in the
mental world in between incarnations who are easy prey to the philosophy of illusion
(which says that all matter is illusion)." K 5.33.16
MENTAL SELF Monad having its most important kind of self-consciousness
in molecular world 47:4-7 within the solar system. Mental selves belonging to the human
kingdom are at the stage of humanity.
MENTAL STAGE "The mental stage is divided into the stages of
humanity and ideality (or the causal stage). The humanist activates consciousness in the
four lowest mental molecular kinds (47:4-7), the idealist in all six (47:2-7). The
humanist is a mental self, the idealist a causal self." K 1.34.18
MENTAL WORLD Molecular world 47:4-7 in the solar system. The mental
world can be said to be the particular world of men where consciousness is concerned.
MENTALIST Man at the mental stage (the stage of humanity).
MINERAL KINGDOM The first or lowest natural kingdom of evolution.
"In the mineral kingdom the monad consciousness begins to be activated. In the lowest
physical molecular kind (49:7) the monads learn to distinguish differences in temperature
and pressure. It is in this kingdom that the vibrations become violent enough for a first
apprehension of inner and outer. And thus begins that process of objectivization of
consciousness which reaches its perfection in the animal kingdom. The monads gradually
learn to apprehend external realities."
"Consciousness in the mineral kingdom is gradually manifested as a tendency to
repetition, after innumerable experiences becoming organized habit, or nature. Increased
consciousness results in instinctive striving to adaptation.
"By being absorbed by plants and experiencing the process of vitalization in these,
mineral consciousness learns to receive and adapt itself to etheric vibrations... a
condition of entering into the vegetable kingdom." K 1.33.2,5f
MINERAL MONAD The monad during evolution in the mineral kingdom is
called mineral monad.
MOLECULAR KINDS "The six molecular kinds within each systemic
world have been given analogous names and mathematical designations:
(1 atomic)
2 subatomic
3 superetheric
4 etheric
5 gaseous
6 liquid
7 solid"  K 1.10.6
MOLECULAR MATTER "The matter of the solar systems is called
molecular matter to distinguish it from atomic matter, which is cosmic. Within the solar
systems the seven lowest atomic kinds are transformed into molecular kinds.
"Each atomic kind supplies material for six successively more composite molecular
kinds, each lower being formed from the next higher. The seven atomic kinds thus make 42
molecular kinds and it is these that make up the solar system. The 49 atomic kinds exist
in all the worlds, occupy the same space." K 1.10.4f
MOLECULAR WORLDS Worlds within the solar system that consist of
molecular matter.
"The three lowest atomic worlds (47- 49) have been divided
into five separate molecular worlds. World 47 is divided into the higher (or causal,
47:2,3) and the lower (47:4-7) mental world. World 49 is divided into the physical etheric
world (49:2-4) and the world visible to man (49:5-7) with its three states of aggregation
(solid, liquid, and gaseous).
"The consciousness development in the four lower natural kingdoms goes on in these
five molecular worlds." K 1.11.3f
MOLECULES "Molecules are composed of atoms. The lower the
molecular kind, the more atoms enter into the molecule." K 1.10.1
MONAD, THE; THE SAME AS PRIMORDIAL ATOM "is
the smallest possible part of primordial matter and the smallest firm point for individual
consciousness." K 1.4.5, 1.12.1
"The monads are the sole content of the cosmos."
"All forms of matter existing in the cosmos consist of monads at different stages of
development. All these compositions of monads are being formed, changed, dissolved, and
re-formed in innumerable variations, but the monads’ matter aspect remains eternally
the same." K 1.12.1f
"By ‘monad’ is meant the individual as a primordial atom and by
‘self’ the individual’s consciousness aspect." K 1.15.3
"The primordial atom’s memory is indestructible though latent. In order to
remember anew it is necessary to renew the contact with previously experienced reality.
Causal selves and higher selves are able to do so in the planetary and cosmic globe
memories." K 1.23.4
"The monad is indestructible individual consciousness which, being originally
potential (unconscious), is awakened to active consciousness in the lowest natural kingdom
of the lowest world (the physical mineral kingdom) and gradually acquires consciousness in
ever higher worlds. Only the coarsest matter offers sufficient resistance for the
subjective monad consciousness to learn to discriminate between the opposites of inner
(subjective) and outer (objective) reality, and to acquire active consciousness, which is
the prerequisite of selfconsciousness in all kinds of reality. After that, the monad is
able by self-activity to acquire the requisite qualities and abilities in ever higher
natural kingdoms in ever higher worlds." K 4.7.4
MONAD, THE (T.B.) The third triad (43:4, 44:1, 45:1). Erroneous term,
since the third triad is an envelope of the monad, an envelope that the monad abandons
before its expansion in the cosmos (beginning in world 42). Moreover, this so-called monad
consists of three units, so by definition it cannot be a monad (Greek for
‘unit’).
MONAD CONSCIOUSNESS "can be potential, actualized, passive,
activated, self-active, latent, subjective, objective." K 1.15.1
MORALS "The terms morals (from Latin) and ethics (from Greek)
through ignorance’s abuse of words have lost their true sense of conception of right
and problems of living together.
"Schopenhauer was the first to demonstrate that up to then no philosopher had
succeeded in making morals into a science or in establishing any tenable grounds for
claiming that there are absolute or objective norms... A number of thinkers then explained
the subjectivity of morals (the conception of right is determined by the level of
development), not illusoriness as prophets of platitudes have expounded the matter.
Hägerström has shown that one cannot speak of a science of ethics, only of a history of
ethics.
"Nobody has contested the fact that certain rules (society’s laws) are necessary
if people are to live together without friction, and that without these there would be a
war of all against all and an ordered society would be impossible."
"It was not against these self-evident insights that criticism was levelled. There
are moral philosophers who have not even understood this! It was levelled against the
multitude of taboos and arbitrary conventions without rational meaning, which have
increased general bewilderment and made it more difficult for people to live together and
increased the seemingly ineradicable hatred with its eternal damning and condemning."
K 5.46.1-5
MOTION One of three aspects of existence. "The original cause of
motion is the dynamic energy of primordial matter." K 1.4.6
"To the motion aspect belong all occurrences, all processes of nature and life, all
changes. Everything is in motion and all that moves is matter.
"Motion has of old been given manifold designations: force, energy, activity,
vibration, etc. As motion should also be considered: sound, light, and colour.
"In hylozoics three main causes of motion are distinguished, each one specifically
different: dynamis, material energy, will." K 1.24
MULADHARA-CHAKRA (Skt) Basal centre
MULAPRAKRITI (Skt "root-matter", T.) Original matter at the
formation of solar systems, 43 atoms.
MYSTERIES "Originally, ‘mysteries’ was the term applied
to ‘secret knowledge’ which was not to be imparted to others than the specially
initiated.
"There are no ‘mysteries’ other than unsolved problems. Once one has got
the necessary facts, the problem and thus the ‘mystery' is solved.
"What the mystics call ‘mysteries’ are realities of which the individual
does not have sufficient experience to be able to comprehend on his level of development.
"Thus ‘mystery’ means either that one lacks the facts to explain it or that
one has reached the limit of individual understanding (all that is beyond one's power of
comprehension)." K 3.6.9ff
In antiquity, mysteries were such elementary esoteric teaching as was given in a
symbolic-dramatic form to large numbers of the population, in contradistinction to the
teaching of the knowledge schools which was reserved for considerably fewer people.
MYSTIC "On the highest cultural levels, the individual becomes a
mystic. In the domains of emotional consciousness that he has now reached, he no longer
has any use for his intellectuality as acquired up to now. Frequently in states of ecstasy
he experiences the unity of life past all understanding. His imagination, which is
powerfully developed, makes him lose himself in seeming infinitude. His emotional
development is terminated and crowned by an incarnation as a saint. In subsequent
incarnations he strives to become a mental self." K 1.34.17
The art of living is the chief interest of the mystic. (K 3.6.4)
N
NADIS (Skt) Threads of etheric matter which together form a network in
the etheric envelope. They shape and vitalize their organic counterparts, the nerves.
NATURAL KINGDOMS The most comprehensive successive stages in the
monads’ evolution and expansion are called natural kingdoms. There are twelve natural
kingdoms: six in the solar system (worlds 43–49) and six in the cosmic worlds
(1–42). The five lower natural kingdoms are natural kingdoms in a more restricted
sense; the seven higher ones are called divine kingdoms. The six kingdoms belonging to the
solar system are:
the mineral kingdom 49:5-7
the vegetable kingdom 49:7-48:7
the animal kingdom 49:7-47:7
the essential kingdom 49:7-45:4
the manifestal kingdom, first or lowest divine kingdom 49:7-43 (K 1.32.1)
NATURE BEING Evolutionary being belonging to
the deva evolution and at stages of development corresponding to the vegetable and animal
kingdoms as well as the lowest human stages. In the normal case, a nature being has no
lower envelopes than the etheric. Nature beings work as builders of organisms for monads
of the human evolution. Of old, nature beings are divided into four groups according to
the four "elements": gnomes (earth), undines (water), sylphs (air), salamanders
(fire). The pixies, fairies, trolls, etc. of folklore have reference to nature beings.
NATURE-SPIRIT See NATURE BEING
NEOPHYTE Beginner in esoteric studies, one newly co-opted into an
esoteric knowledge order.
NIRMANAKAYA (Skt) Particular category of second selves who have kept
their first triads. Their task is to accumulate higher energies and transform them for use
in worlds 47-49.
NIRVANA (Skt) World 45 and its consciousness. (K 1.9.4)
"Nirvana is not the extinction of the self, not the end but the beginning, an
entering into a higher natural kingdom." K 1.2.18, 5.33.14
NOUMENON (Greek) Mental reality in contrast to physical reality
(phaenomenon). (K 5.4.19, 5.28.16)
O
OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS The ability of consciousness to directly
observe "its" own kind of matter. Instances are the sense perceptions of the
organism in the physical world. Objective self-consciousness implies simultaneous
awareness of the self as the centre of perception: "I am seeing this."
"Sense" is another word for objective consciousness. (K 1.17.2)
OBJECTIVISM ‘To doubt the existence of the external world, or that
we can apprehend it as it is in its given physical reality, is to doubt one’s own
common sense and all correct apprehensions of reality.
‘The fact that there are superphysical material worlds in which we apprehend material
reality differently, several ever higher states of aggregation of cosmic matter, does not
in any way refute the physical apprehension of reality, the only correct one in the
physical world.’ K 5.43.8f
OBJECTIVIZATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS ‘Only the coarsest matter offers
sufficient resistance for the subjective monad consciousness to learn to discriminate
between the opposites of inner (subjective) and outer (objective) reality, and to acquire
active consciousness, which is the prerequisite of self-consciousness in all kinds of
reality. After that, the monad is able by self-activity to acquire the requisite qualities
and abilities in ever higher natural kingdoms in ever higher worlds.’ K 4.7.4
In the three lowest natural kingdoms, the monads eventually learn to apprehend outer
realities.
‘Immensely slowly through the three lowest kingdoms, the monads come to see
themselves as something separate from everything else.’ K 1.33.2
OCCULTISM An older term for superphysics.
OMNIPOTENCE Complete control of the matter and motion aspects within a
world. The monad reaches the lowest kind of omnipotence in the first divine kingdom (in
world 43 and 44 in the solar system).
‘Omnipotence is possible only through absolutely faultless application of the laws in
their entirety.’ K 1.41.3, 4.11.7
OMNISCIENCE ‘Omniscience does not mean that the individual knows
everything, but that he is able, when need be, quickly to find out anything he wants to
know in his worlds, independently of space and past time.’ K 1.35.8
The lowest kind of omniscience, that the monad reaches in the first divine kingdom (in the
worlds 43 and 44 in the solar system).
‘Anyone who possesses knowledge of all laws in all worlds is omniscient.’ K
4.11.7
ORGANISMS Monad envelopes in the physical world consisting of its three
lowest molecular kinds (49:5-7), organized into cells, tissues, and organs.
‘In our solar system there are organisms on our planet only. On the other planets
also the lowest envelope (49:5-7) is an aggregate envelope.’ K 1.13.3
‘It is by no means necessary for the monad to develop through organic envelopes. In
actual fact, most monads (those following the parallel deva evolution, for instance) have
never had other bodies than aggregate envelopes consisting of atoms and molecules held
together electromagnetically, such as man has in all worlds except in the visible.’ K
4.8.5
OUTPOURINGS, THREE (T.) Three processes of manifestation as seen from
the viewpoint of the first self. The first outpouring: the process of involvation, the
composition of matter down to world 49. The second outpouring: involution down to world
49, evolution (up from world 49), which has now reached world 47. The third outpouring:
the voluntary "descension" of perfected second and third selves to world 46 and
44, respectively, to facilitate, as Augoeides and Protogonoi, respectively, the evolution
of first selves (human beings).
P
PAPER POPE Just as the Roman Catholic Church has a pope invested with
infallible authority for the believers, so the Protestant Churches have the Bible as their
paper pope.
PARALLEL EVOLUTIONS After the mineral kingdom, evolution parts into
three parallel lines, of which only one (the so-called human evolution) leads the monads
to the human kingdom. The two others are summed up in the term the "deva
evolution". The purpose of the parallel paths of development is the education of
specialists in the work of manifestation: the "human evolution" specializes in
the consciousness aspect and educates supervisors of evolution, the two others aim
primarily at the motion and matter aspects and educate administrators of the Law and
formers of matter.
PARAMAHAMSA (Skt) 46-self, initiate of the fourth degree. Synonym:
Arhat.
PARANIRVANA World 44, the submanifestal world, in the solar system.
PASSIVE CONSCIOUSNESS (Skt, T.) World 44, the submanifestal world, in
the solar system.
PASSIVE CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness that has not yet acquired the
ability of self-activity, initiative, will. Passive consciousness must be activated by
vibrations coming in from without, emitted by self-active evolutionary beings.
The elementals of involution have only passive (mirroring) consciousness. Instances of
elementals are man’s emotional and mental envelopes, which can be activated by the
human monad. (K 2.9.2, D 2.11)
PERIODICITY, LAW OF "The cosmic energies are uninterruptedly
active. But in the solar systems their activity is increased and decreased in accordance
with a periodicity inevitable for the pertaining material processes (the so-called law of
periodicity), the rhythm of which varies with every world, every kind of matter, every
kind of material envelopes.
"This law of periodicity is what makes everything within the solar systems and in the
relations of the systems to each other proceed in regularly recurring periods, or cycles,
that can be determined mathematically." K 2.12.4f
PERSONALITY (T.B.) Has reference to:
1. Man’s self-consciousness in his organism (with etheric envelope), emotional and
mental envelopes.
2. The first triad.
3. The envelope of the first triad, the lesser causal envelope (47:3), the triad envelope.
PERSPECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS See ELITE THINKING
PHAINOMENON (Gr.) Physical reality.
PHILOSOPHY "Philosophy is limited to physical reality and
therefore, physically, all philosophy remains physicalism and, superphysically,
subjectivism: speculations without reality content. In order to speak about the
superphysical one must have factual knowledge of the superphysical worlds." K 5.38.2
"The philosophers have not yet managed to solve the basic problem of existence:
trinity; the three equal, inseparable aspects of existence. Ever since the Greek sophists,
the whole history of philosophy has been dominated by the subjectivist way of looking at
things." K 5.43.21
PHYSICAL CONSCIOUSNESS Physical consciousness (49) is the lowest kind
of consciousness. Man’s physical consciousness is partly the organism’s
different kinds of sense perceptions, partly the
PHYSICAL SELF Human monad that has its consciousness concentrated on
physical reality and small activation of emotional and mental consciousness. Also called
physicalist.
PHYSICAL WORLD Atomic world 49 in the cosmos and solar system. Within
the planets it is divided into two molecular worlds: the physical etheric world (49:2-4)
and the "visible world" (49:5-7).
PHYSICALISM The view that limits its understanding of reality to the
physical world and so tries to explain all reality within the limits of physical reality.
"This view has been called philosophical or scientific materialism. More properly it
ought to be called physicalism, since it took into account physical matter only, and there
is a whole series of ever higher material worlds."
"The physicalist is wrong in assuming that the visible world is the only existing
one, that organisms are the only forms of life, that the organism’s sense organs are
man's only means of apprehending the material external world." K 5.10.2,4
PHYSICALIST Term referring to two different things:
1. An adherent of physicalism, a "materialist".
2. A physical self.
PLANE (T.B.) Atomic kind with six molecular kinds. Atomic world with
six molecular worlds. "Plane" is a less appropriate term, since the worlds are
multi-dimensional and they all exist in the same space. They are not situated in layers,
as the term "plane" intimates.
PLANETARY CHAIN (T.B.) Seven-globe.
"A great mistake [by Judge] is his assertion that the planetary chain does not
consist of seven separate globes. Judge’s saying that by this is meant the higher
worlds of our planet, is incorrect. K 3.5.16
PLANETARY DEVELOPMENT "The planets in the solar system undergo
seven different processes of development, divided into seven periods of activity and
passivity called eons (Sanskrit: kalpas with manvantara and pralaya)." K 2.13.4
PLANETARY ENERGIES The planets receive energies from each other. Each
planet represents predominantly someone of the seven cosmic types.
PLANETARY GOVERNMENT "Into the planetary government can enter
individuals who have attained the second divine kingdom. The head of the planetary
government belongs to the third kingdom.
"Like all governments in still higher kingdoms, the planetary government is divided
into three main departments dealing with the three fundamental functions concerning the
aspects of matter, motion, and consciousness. They have the ultimate responsibility that
all the pertaining processes of nature work with unfailing precision. They see to it that
all receive what they need for their consciousness development and that implacable justice
is done to all in accordance with the law of sowing and reaping." K 1.39.1f
Our planet received its own government about 21,7 million years ago. (K 3.1.4)
PLANETARY HIERARCHY "The
individuals of the fifth and sixth natural kingdoms constitute the hierarchy of our
planet, which has acquired atomic consciousness in the planetary worlds 46 and 45 as well
as 44 and 43.
"The hierarchy is divided into seven departments, each of which works with its
specialized energy that functions in accordance with the systemic law of periodicity.
"The hierarchy supervises evolution in the lower kingdoms, taking an especial
interest in those at the stage of humanity who with onepointed purpose seek to acquire the
twelve essential qualities in order the better to serve life." K 1.38.1ff
About 21 million years ago, the planetary government transferred to our planet individuals
who were given the special mission of supervising the development of human consciousness.
Members of this planetary hierarchy incarnated in mankind. (K 3.1.4)
PLANETARY HISTORY "The work of the planetary hierarchy can be read
in the planetary history of the consciousness development of the four lower natural
kingdoms, which goes on in the physical world. This history is to its full extent
preserved in the collective memory of the submanifestal world." K 2.17.3
PLANETARY RULER The head of the planetary government, the highest
developed monad in our planet. Has attained the third divine kingdom (29-35).
PLANETARY WORLDS "The four lower solar systemic worlds (46-49) are
also called planetary worlds." K 1.11.2
POST-EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL The continued existence of the soul after
the death of the body.
POTENTIAL CONSCIOUSNESS The unconsciousness of the monad, its
consciousness not yet awakened. This potential consciousness is awakened (actualized) in
the cosmos. (K 1.15.2)
Opposite: Actualized consciousness.
PRAKRITI (Skt) Matter
PRALAYA (Skt) Period of passivity at the beginning of which all lower
matter is dissolved.
Opposite: Manvantara.
PRANA (Skt, T.B.) Etheric energy (49:1-4), in the last analysis
originating in the worlds 36-42. Five kinds of prana periodically vitalize man’s
etheric envelope recurring periodically at intervals of two hours. (K 2.12.7, P 2.20.8)
PREDICTION "Everything that happens is the result of causes that
can lie however far back in time. In order to be able to foresee the future, one must have
knowledge of those factors in the past which have not yet been released. The uncertainty
consists in not knowing about factors that may arise between the moment of prediction and
the definite event itself. The future most often appears as a manifoldness of different
possibilities. Which of these is to be realized is uncertain." K 3.5.20
PRE-EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL The existence of the soul prior to the
formation of the body.
PRIMARY MATTER When primordial atoms have
been introduced into the cosmos from chaos, they form the compounded atomic kinds 2-49.
These atoms have rotatory motion. Therefore, this first matter is called rotatory matter
or primary matter. In worlds 43-49, the atoms of primary matter are further composed to
form 42 molecular kinds. Primary matter has only potential consciousness. Primary matter
exists in all the worlds 1-49.
Synonym: involvatory matter. (K 1.7, 6.8.18; P 2.9, 2.4.3)
PRIMORDIAL ATOM See MONAD
PRIMORDIAL MATTER "Primordial
matter is matter proper. Primordial matter is not atomic but of homogenous consistency,
with the two seemingly contradictory qualifications: absolute density and absolute
elasticity. In primordial matter exist potentially all known and unknown qualities of
life, which find expression in atomized manifestational matter." P 2.60.1
Primordial matter is at the same time limitless space. In this unmanifested primordial
matter, "beyond space and time", there is an unlimited number of cosmoses. (K
1.5)
"Primordial matter is unconscious." P 2.60.4
PRINCIPLE THINKING The second kind of thinking from below (47:6).
Mostly makes real phenomena absolute, since concepts are absolute.. (K 1.20.4f)
PRINCIPLES Bodies or envelopes. In T. and B. the organism is sometimes
included sometimes excluded. It is said that the organism "is not a principle",
which means that it has not been formed directly through some triad unit (as has the
etheric envelope) but through reflexive action from the etheric envelope.
PROOFS OF THE CORRECTNESS OF HYLOZOICS "There are five proofs, for
those who need them, of the correctness of hylozoics (its agreement with reality), each
one of them by itself wholly sufficient, being of matchless logical tenability. These five
are: the logical proof, the proof by explanation, the proof by prediction, the proof by
clairvoyance, the experimental proof." K 1.3.4
PROTOGONOS (Gr.) Pythagorean term for a category of devas having 44-
and 43-consciousness. Their tasks in connection with the human evolution consist, among
other duties, in being in charge of the third triads until the second selves can take
possession of them.
PURE REASON (T.B.) Essential consciousness (46:1-7).
Q
QUASI-OCCULTISM The planetary hierarchy asserts emphatically that man
cannot on his own acquire knowledge of higher worlds than the physical. All true knowledge
of superphysical reality is a gift from the planetary hierarchy. Ever since esoterics
began to be publicized in 1875, people ignorant of esoterics (also discarnate people in
the emotional world) have put together their own systems on the basis of esoteric facts
they have misunderstood and complemented with their own fanciful speculation. The result
of this ongoing distortion has been that most of what is today presented as
‘esoterics’ must be called quasi-occultism.
Quasi-occultism is a phenomenon at the emotional stage (the stages of civilization and
culture). Anyone who has reached the mental stage and has acquired perspective thinking
possesses sufficient common sense to see through the attractive illusions of prospects of
absurdly rapid ‘spiritual’ development which are part and parcel of the typical
offers of the quasi-occult movements. If, in addition, he has come in contact with
esoterics, he immediately realizes that it is incomparably superior as an explanation.
This power of discrimination does not exist at the emotional stage (including the levels
of the mystic).
It is important to understand that quasi-occult teachings do not primarily satisfy
man’s mental needs (knowledge) but his emotional ones (comfort). At a transitional
stage, they may be of great therapeutic value, help people to overcome repulsive
emotionality. Therefore, the esoterician wishes neither to oppose those movements nor to
convert their followers. On the other hand, he informs about the factual conditions to the
benefit of those who in their individual development are in the process of leaving the
emotional stage and are grateful for the aid given them for their liberation.
QUATERNARY MATTER Higher kind of evolutionary matter, individual
matter. Before the monad can become quaternary matter, it must have been in succession
primary (involvatory and evolvatory) matter, secondary (involutionary, elemental) matter,
and tertiary (lower evolutionary) matter. Examples of quaternary matter are the monads in
the natural kingdoms of evolution.
QUIETISM "We do not achieve freedom through quietism, through
omitting to act. No development will be brought about through inactivity, idleness,
through begging the deity to do what it is our dharma to do. We free ourselves by acting,
by taking a positive attitude to everything we meet with, by letting the divine powers act
in us and through us, which they unfailingly will do as soon as we remove the obstacles to
their reception." K 7.9.7
R
RACES On each globe mankind develops in seven
successive (in time partially overlapping) root-races. By analogy with this, each
root-race develops seven sub-races and each sub-race seven branch-races or nations. The
life-time of a nation has been calculated at 30 000 years. We are presently in the fifth
sub-race of the fifth root-race. (P 2.36)
RAJA YOGA "Raja yoga is concerned with the consciousness aspect of
existence, in its esoteric part extending far beyond consciousness in the human worlds.
There would be a certain justification for calling it the ‘science of
attention’." K 7.17.1
RAY (T.B.) Fundamental type. See DEPARTMENT
REAPING, THE LAW OF "The law of reaping says that all the good and
evil we have initiated in thoughts, feelings, words, and deeds are returned to us with the
same effect. Every consciousness manifestation has an effect in manifold ways and entails
either good or bad sowing which will ripen and be reaped some time." K 1.41.13
"If man lives in accordance with the laws of life, his development will progress as
rapidly as possibly, without friction, harmoniously, with the greatest possible degree of
happiness. But every mistake as to the laws of life (known or unknown ones) entails
consequences calculated eventually (the number of incarnations is up to him) to teach the
individual to discover the laws and apply them correctly. If he has caused suffering to
other beings, he is himself to experience the same measure of suffering. This is the law
of uncompromising justice which no arbitrary grace can free him from.
"It is part of man’s dharma that he must do all he can to reduce the suffering
in the world, for all beings and in all circumstances. Those who refuse to help when they
can, are guilty of an omission that has consequences and by no means the least ones.
"The Brahmins’ conception of karma as being inevitable destiny, that one
‘stands in the way of karma’ by trying to relieve suffering and distress, is
evidence of fatal ignorance of life. Nobody can ‘stand in the way’ of a law. If
anyone is to suffer, no power in the world can prevent that. The suffering we have caused
to others can be made good through voluntary ‘sacrifice’ in future lives."
K 7.8.4ff
REASON Subjective consciousness. "Reason is the faculty of
imagination, abstraction, conception, reflection, deduction, judgement, etc." K
1.17.3
"Reason is the instrument for working up the content of sense. Reason obtains all its
reality material and knowledge material from sense." K 5.25.10
REBIRTH (Reincarnation) "Man is reborn as a man (never as an
animal), until he has learned everything he can learn in the human kingdom, and has
acquired all the qualities and abilities necessary to enable him to continue his
consciousness expansion in the fifth natural kingdom. Rebirth explains both the seeming
injustices of life (since in new lives the individual has to reap what he has sown in
precious lives) and the innate, latent understanding and the once self-acquired abilities
existing as predispositions." K 1.34.4
REGIONS The planets’ different kinds of molecular matter –
physical 49:2-7, emotional 48:2-7, causal-mental 47:2-7 – interpenetrate, exist in
the same space. In addition, each higher molecular kind extends beyond the lower kinds, so
that it forms its own "layer" in a concentrical grouping of the different
matters round the centre of the planet. These "layers" are called regions. The
analogy with man’s organism and aura is obvious.
There are six physical, six emotional, and six causal-mental regions in our planet. The
physical planet with its atmosphere is only the inmost dense material nucleus of a
considerably larger globe.
RELIGION "The emotional task of religion has been that of freeing
man from fear and anxiety, of giving him faith in life and in the power of good; and of
mysticism in all religions that of granting enduring bliss and ‘the peace that
passeth all understanding’." K 1.43.1
"The emotional world with its hatred (48:5-7) and love (48:2-4) is the world of
religion." K 5.45.11
REMEMBRANCE ANEW "Everything which we are able immediately to
grasp, comprehend, understand, we have assimilated in previous incarnations. Also
qualities and abilities once acquired remain latently, until they are given opportunities
to develop in some new incarnation." K 1.1.36
"Remembrance anew is the ability to resuscitate the vibrations received or emitted by
the envelopes."
"The primordial atom’s memory is indestructible though latent. In order to
remember anew it is necessary to renew the contact with previously experienced reality.
Causal selves and higher selves are able to do this in the planetary and cosmic globe
memories." K 1.23.2,4
"Everything we have once learned and worked up (!) we are unable to lose. Whatever we
have known and been able to do is there latently. Knowledge becomes instant understanding
in later lives. Qualities and abilities acquired are there as predispositions. They can be
actualized quickly if need be, if the interest is there, and an opportunity for
re-acquisition is offered." K 5.8.14
You cannot, "as the esoterically ignorant at times imagine, revive what is latent in
the subconscious by being absorbed into oneself. Knowledge previously acquired is
re-acquired through studying anew the same subject-matter in new incarnations. The new
brain knows nothing of what the old brain knew, but must be impregnated anew with mental
molecules." K 6.7.12
REPULSION The characteristic quality of vibrations in the three lower
molecular kinds in the emotional world (48:5-7) of our planet. The individual apprehends
the pertaining consciousness as various kinds of expressions of hatred (contempt, anger,
fear, etc.)
"Development in monads of repulsive basic tendency can take a wrong course, this
showing already in parasitism of plants and in predacity of animals." K 4.11.4
RIGHT, CONCEPTION OF "An individual’s independent conception
of right indicates his level of development attained and understanding of life
acquired." K 5.9.30
"All conception of right ultimately rests on the understanding of the meaning and
goal of life and of its conformity to law. Its lawfulness can be seen in the principle of
reciprocity: ‘an eye for an eye’ among barbarians and ‘do as you would be
done by’ among the civilized." K 5.28.24
"Since the conception of right comes from the life view, which in its turn is based
on the world view, the general disintegration of systems had led to a disintegration of
the concepts of right and justice, and thus to general lawlessness. ‘People often
feel profoundly uncertain as to what is right and wrong. They are not even certain that
right and wrong are anything but old superstition.’" K 5.37.2
"It is always a matter for the individual whether he will adhere to anyone of the
many collective conceptions or take his own standing. We cannot hope for a universal
conception of the best way to realize the meaning of life until mankind has managed to
solve the problems of existence." K 5.46.6
"The individual’s conception of right is determined by his individual character,
and belongs to his level of development. The understanding of a certain conception of
right is innate." P 3.16.7
RISHIS (Skt) Teachers at the temple schools of Atlantis. They were
members of the planetary hierarchy. (K 7.3.1)
ROBOT ACTIVITY "The expressions of man’s emotional and mental
consciousness can be divided into two groups: self-activity and robot activity (including
‘habitual thinking’: automatized emotional and mental associations originally
his own).
"Over 80 per cent of most people's consciousness activity is emotional and mental
robot activity." K 2.9.5f
ROOT-RACE See RACES
THE ROSICRUCIAN ORDER was instituted in 1375 by Christian Rosencreutz
at the request of the planetary hierarchy. This original, true Rosicrucian Order has never
divulged its teaching and has never recruited members publicly. It has remained secret.
ROTATORY MATTER See PRIMARY MATTER
ROUND (T.B.) The passage of the processes of evolution and involution

RUPA (Skt "having shape", T.B.)
S
SAHASRARA-PADMA-CHAKRA (Skt) The crown centre.
SAINT Emotional genius, man on the highest level of the higher
emotional stage, or the stage of culture. The saint has attained the emotional ideal of a
loving relationship to all living things. However, it remains to realize the mental ideal - knowledge of reality and the purpose of action -
before the self is finished with the human kingdom. (K 1.34.17)
"When the self can maintain itself in the highest emotional consciousness (48:2), the
individual is what Christian mysticism calls a saint." K 7.17.12
SALAMANDERS See NATURE BEING
SAMADHI (Skt "contemplation"). The highest stage in esoteric
meditation, in which consciousness merges with the object of meditation.
"True samadhi requires in the first place the ability to centre the monad-the self in
the innermost crown chakra. In genuine samadhi the organism is fully active, directed by
the lowest triad, while the monad, centred in one of the three units of the second triad,
is active elsewhere, centred in one of the three worlds of the triad." K 7.11.11
SCALING DOWN The cosmos consists of 49 atomic worlds, seven series of
seven worlds in each series. Worlds 1- 7 is the basis and
prototype of all lower worlds.
"The lower septenary series are thus scaled down replicas of those immediately
‘above’ them. This scaling down is a result of the increased density of
primordial atoms and is especially noticeable in the case of the aspects of consciousness
and motion." K 2.2.4
SCHEME (T.B.) A 49-globe, a succession of seven seven-globes.
SCIENCE "The task of science is to explore physical, but not
superphysical reality. Without the facts of esoterics, mankind will remain ignorant of 46
of the 49 cosmic worlds, science will be able to explore only the 49th." K 1.43.2
"Natural science seeks to explore visible, physical reality. Thereby its task is
given and at the same time its inevitable limitation. Science is physicalism."
"Science makes its way slowly, advancing step by step, by ascertaining facts. These
facts are summed up in theories and are explained be hypotheses. Both theories and
hypotheses are continually being changed through newly ascertained facts. Facts, theories,
and hypotheses are joined together into a thought system which is regarded as scientific
truth. These temporarily ruling systems of orientation, which show how far research has
advanced, are continually being changed because of new facts with new theories and
hypotheses. Facts that cannot be fitted into the prevailing systems of theories and
hypotheses, are regarded as doubtful. Facts that it is not possible to ascertain by the
methods of research used by scientists, are not regarded as facts. It follows from this
that the most important quality of an hypothesis is not its being true, but its being
probable: acceptable to science with its tremendously limited ability to explain." K
5.42.1,3
SECOND HUMAN TYPE "The second type is that of the wise man, of him
possessing knowledge, insight, and understanding. He is the born teacher, able and willing
to unite conflicting conceptions and individuals, etc." K 2.7.10
SECOND SELF Monad having objective self-consciousness in any of the
three units of the second triad, individual of the fifth kingdom. They are divided into
causal selves (47:1), essential selves (46:1) and superessential selves (45:4).
SECOND TRIAD See TRIADS
SECONDARY MATTER "Primary matter is
rotatory matter. The atom rotates round its axis with enormous rapidity. To this motion is
added, through the process of involution, a cyclic spiral motion (which the ancients
called the elemental essence), in which the atom revolves round a central, focal point in
a constantly ascending spiral.
"The rotatory motion of the atom of primary matter makes the formation of molecules
possible. The rotatory cyclic spiral motion of secondary matter makes it possible to form
aggregates, material forms. This makes it possible to construct and progressively
differentiate the series of ever higher, ever more refined forms of life, which serve to
afford consciousness, step by step, with the different organs it needs for the slow
activation of molecular consciousness.
"Secondary matter is called involutionary or elemental matter." P 2.9.4ff (K
6.8.18)
-SELF The term -self in reference to an individual (a 45-self, for
instance) indicates the highest world in which he has acquired full subjective and
objective self-consciousness and ability of self-activity.
By first, second, and third selves are meant monads that have self-consciousness and
ability of self-activity in their first, second, and third triads, respectively. Man is a
first self. The individuals in the fifth natural kingdom are second selves; and those in
the sixth natural kingdom, third selves.
SELF, THE "By the term monad is meant the individual as a
primordial atom and by self the individual’s consciousness aspect.
"The term self is also applied to those envelopes in which the monad has acquired
self-consciousness, with which the self identifies itself, at the time regarding them as
its true self. The self is the centre in all self-apprehensions. Attention indicates the
presence of the self." K 1.15.3f
SELF, HIGHER (T.B.) See EGO
SELF OR SELF-REALIZATION, LAW OF "The law of self says that every
monad must itself acquire all the qualities and abilities requisite for omniscience and
omnipotence, from the human kingdom and onwards: understanding of law and the
responsibility following upon this." K 1.41.11
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS The monad’s consciousness of being a self. Is
conquered in the human kingdom and is subsequently never lost when entering ever greater
consciousness collectives.
SENSE "Objective consciousness, the apprehension by consciousness
of objective material reality in all worlds." K 1.17.2
"Sense is direct, immediate, unreflective experience of reality. The attempt of the
subjectivists to explain this psychologically is illogical and misleading, a confusion of
logical and psychological problems... After testing, sense is always proved right. Our
mistakes begin with doubting the correctness of sense, with incorrect working up by
reason, with hypotheses and other kinds of guesswork." K 5.25.10
"Physical sense is the ability of apprehending objectively the objective material
realities in the ‘visible’, physical world. During his physical incarnation, man
lives in five different material worlds, since he has a material envelope in all five. It
remains for the normal individual, in the course of development and during thousands of
incarnations, to acquire objective consciousness in all his five envelopes, thus beside
physical sense to acquire also physical etheric, emotional, mental, and causal
sense." K 6.8.3
SENZAR, SENSA (Tib.) Ancient symbolic language used by initiates of all
nations.
SEPARATION OR ISOLATION, LAW OF "says that every being must –
in order to develop the self-reliance and self-determination of individual character
– become conscious of itself as something separate from everything else. The human
stage marks that phase of development during which the atomic consciousness is isolated
from the consciousness of other beings." P 3.2.17
SERVICE "According to the planetary hierarchy, the serving
attitude to life is the easiest, safest, quickest path to the fifth natural kingdom. All
kingdoms capable of it have as their foremost task of life serving those at lower stages
of development, so that they will be able to reach higher ones. Without this help there
would be no evolution, or evolution would take tremendously longer time. "He who
gives shall receive." Those who serve mankind unselfishly are given more and more
opportunities of doing so. Service itself develops all requisite qualities and abilities,
frees from emotional illusions and mental fictions." K 7.20.3 (K 7.15.15, 7.23.7ff)
SEVEN DEPARTMENTS OF THE PLANETARY HIERARCHY "Our planetary
hierarchy (not government) is divided into seven departments. In each department there are
four degrees consisting of 43-selves, 44-selves, 45-selves, and 46-selves."
"The seven departments in the planet are replicas of the seven departments of the
solar system and, to a certain degree, also of the seven types constantly recurring in the
cosmic kingdoms." K 2.6.2,5
The types of the planetary hierarchy are also called the seven planetary types in
contradistinction to the seven cosmic and seven human types.
SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL ENERGIES From the seven highest cosmic worlds (1-7)
"emanate all the material energies which form matter and the worlds and make the
cosmos a living whole constantly changing." K 2.11.7
SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL TYPES "The monads are introduced into the cosmos
from chaos via one or another of the seven highest cosmic worlds. This sets a certain
stamp on them from the beginning, so that seven types of monads can be distinguished.
"The first three types of the septenary series are the most pronounced expressions of
the three aspects. The first type is the extreme force type (aspect of motion), the second
type represents the consciousness aspect, and the third type the matter aspect. The four
others are differentiations of the first three in more composed matter.
"Types 1, 3, 5, 7 are rather expressive of the objective side of existence; types 2,
4, 6, of its subjective side.
"With each lower cosmic kingdom (septenary series of atomic worlds), the types
undergo modifications conditioned by the material composition. The types thus prove
different in different in different worlds." K 2.5.1-4
SEVEN HIGHEST WORLDS IN THE COSMOS "The cosmic worlds are built
out from ‘above’..." "The seven highest worlds are formed first. They
are the foundation of everything in the cosmos. They constitute the cosmic groundplan, the
pattern for the repeated septenary division of atomic worlds. The lower septenary series
are thus scaled down replicas of those immediately ‘above’ them." K 2.2.4
"The seven highest cosmic worlds (1-7) constitute the foundation of everything in the
cosmos. They are made up of monads which have gone through the process of manifestation in
another cosmos, have learnt to handle dynamis (the eternally blind omnipotence of
primordial matter, the source of all power) and in their turn are now building out the
cosmos and directing the process of manifestation." K 2.11.6
SEVENTH HUMAN TYPE "The seventh type is the man of order with a
marked sense of everything belonging to procedure, ceremony, ritual, etc." K 2.7.15
SHAMBALLA (Skt) The physical (although in 49:2 at the lowest)
headquarters of the planetary government, situated in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia.
SHIVA (Skt, T.B.)
1. One of the "persons" in Trimurti. Symbolizes the motion
aspect and its kind of collective beings.
2. Devaraja of world 43.
SIXTH HUMAN TYPE "The sixth type is the mainly emotional
imaginative man in the spheres of religion, literature, etc. with traits of fanaticism and
well-marked sympathy-antipathy." K 2.7.14
SIXTH NATURAL KINGDOM Also called
first divine kingdom. "The lowest divine kingdom is made up of those individuals who
have acquired envelopes and consciousness in the two highest systemic worlds (43 and 44).
They have at their disposal the two highest collective consciousnesses of the solar
system. They are omniscient in the solar system, independently of space in that globe and
its past time. One realizes that they have complete mastery of the aspects of matter and
motion and of the Law within the worlds 43-49." K 1.36
SKANDHAS "Manifestations of consciousness activate the matter in
the envelopes. Constant vibrations (habits, tendencies, etc.) retain ‘permanent
atoms’ (Sanskrit: skandhas). On the dissolution of the envelopes they enter into the
causal envelope and follow it at reincarnation, constituting the latent fund of
experiences (predispositions, talents, etc.)." K 1.23.3 (K 1.34.24)
SLEEP "Ordinary sleep is obtained when the emotional envelope,
together with higher envelopes, leaves the organism and its etheric envelope." K
7.11.12
SOKRATEAN REALIZATION The realization that man cannot on his own (by
self-taught clairvoyance, meditation, speculation) attain to knowledge of reality and
life. That realization is the result of sufficient experience of mankind’s collected
ignorance, through history, in theology, philosophy, science, and, in our times,
occultism. The Sokratean realization is a condition of a successful study of esoterics.
SOLAR ANGEL (T.B.) Has reference to Augoeides. Synonyms: the Soul
(sometimes), the Ego (sometimes), the Son of Mind, Manasa Deva, Manasa Putra (sometimes),
Agnishvatta.
SOLAR SYSTEMS Are globes in the cosmos. Those globes are replicas of
the cosmos enormously down-scaled with everything that implies in all respects, especially
consciousness.
"The solar systems have seven worlds composed of the seven lowest atomic matters
(43-49)." K 1.9.3
SOLAR SYSTEMIC DEVELOPMENT "Every solar system undergoes three
different stages of development corresponding to the three aspects: those of matter,
consciousness, and motion. In each of the three periods the solar system undergoes a
complete remoulding." K 2.13.3
Our solar system is halfway through the second stage.
SOLAR SYSTEMIC ENERGIES The solar systems make up a widely branched-out
network for distribution of cosmic energies, which are coming in from worlds 36-42. (K
2.13.1f)
"The solar systems of higher degrees transmit the cosmic energies to those of lower
degrees. Our solar system is of the second degree. The energies from other solar systems
reach the planets via the sun, which has the task, among others, of transforming the
atomic energies into molecular energies." K 2.13.5
SOLAR SYSTEMIC GOVERNMENT "To enter into the solar systemic
government it is necessary to have attained the third divine kingdom. It supervises, of
course, everything in the solar system, receives directions from higher governments and
gives directions to the planetary governments.
"It also transmits knowledge received concerning the cosmos and the Law to the extent
that this is necessary to the fulfilment of the functions." K 1.40.1f
SOLAR SYSTEMIC WORLDS The seven lowest cosmic worlds (43-49) are called
solar systemic worlds, since the solar systems are made of their matter.
"The three higher worlds of the solar system (43-45) are common to all who in the
solar system have acquired objective consciousness in the respective kinds of
matter."
"The four lower systemic worlds (46-49) are also called planetary worlds." K
1.11.1f
SOUL (B.) The following seven distinct meanings of the word
‘soul’ are to be found in the B. literature:
1. Consciousness in general (the consciousness aspect).
2. The causal envelope and its passive consciousness.
3. The second triad and its passive consciousness (which is passive until the monad has
become a second self).
4. The human monad in general (often called the "human soul").
5. The monad having attained self-consciousness in the causal envelope (the monad as a
causal self).
6. The monad having attained self-consciousness in the essential envelope (the monad as a
46-self).
7. Augoeides (a 46-self of the deva evolution).
SPACE "Space, not being space in the absolute sense of the word,
is limitless primordial matter. In the cosmic sense, space is always a globe." K
1.8.1f
There are 49 kinds of matter in cosmos, its 49 dimensions. (K 1.8)
SPIRIT (T.B.) Vague term used by esotericians in the following senses:
1. Will, in contrast to matter. (P 2.62.3)
2. Consciousness in general and in contrast to matter. (K 1.4.1, 3.2.10f)
3. The three higher of a septenary whereas the four lower are called "matter".
(P 2.62.3 )
4. The 45-envelope and -consciousness of the monad. (K 1.16.8, 3.4.11)
5. The third triad, its consciousness and will. (P 2.62.5)
STHULA (Skt) Physical matter.
SUBCONSCIOUS "The monad’s subconsciousness contains, in their
latent state, all the monad’s perceptions and worked-up experiences ever since the
monad's consciousness was awakened to life. Each incarnation deposits, as it were, its own
layer of consciousness. All this is preserved as rudiments of qualities and abilities,
usually manifesting as possibility of understanding. For these rudiments to be actualized
it is necessary that they be developed in each new incarnation, a process that is
nevertheless increasingly easier."
"Man is constantly receiving impulses from his subconsciousness." K 1.23.3,5
SUBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS That limited consciousness which experiences
only itself, thus not the matter and motion aspects in "its" world. Man’s
feelings and thoughts are subjective.
Reason is another word for subjective consciousness. (K 1.17.3)
SUBJECTIVE WORLDS, KINDS OF MATTER etc. (B.) "A further confusion
of ideas has been caused by terming the material reality invisible to the normal
individual subjective, as opposed to the visible reality as objective. There is no
subjective matter. Just the first apprehension of matter is subjective. Everything that
belongs to the consciousness aspect is subjective, everything that belongs to the matter
aspect is objective." 2.62.12
SUBJECTIVISM "Consistent subjectivism leads to complete
disorientation in existence, sovereign arbitrariness, lack of principle, and
irresponsibility." K 5.37.1
"Attempting to explain external, objective, material reality by sense perceptions is
typical of the modern subjectivists, whether they call themselves psychologicists of
logicists."
"To doubt the existence of the external world, or that we can apprehend it as it is
in its given physical reality, is to doubt one's own common sense and all correct
apprehension of reality." K 5.43.6,8
SUBMANIFESTAL SELF, 44-SELF Monad having its highest kind of envelope
and self-consciousness in the submanifestal world of the solar system (44).
SUBMANIFESTAL WORLD Atomic world 44 in the cosmos and the solar system.
Molecular world 44:2-7 in the solar system.
SUB-PLANE (T.B.) Molecular kind.
SUB-RACE See RACES
SUFFERING "Life is joy, happiness, bliss in the mental and all
higher worlds." K 1.41.18
"Suffering exists only in the three lower molecular kinds of the physical and
emotional worlds (48:5-7; 49:5-7), and then only as bad reaping after bad sowing." K
1.35.20
SUNS "The suns are transformers that convert atomic matter into
molecular matter. What we see is just an external physical gaseous envelope." K 1.9.2
"The energies from other solar systems reach the planets via the sun, which has the
task, among others, of transforming the atomic energies into molecular energies. These
seven main kinds of molecular energies, like all septenaries, can be divided into three
higher and four lower. The three circulate interplanetarily; the four are distributes to
the planets, in which process the principle of circulation is also employed, so that the
planets receive energy from each other." K 2.13.5
The sun as an esoteric symbols has reference to the second triad, its kinds of
consciousness and energy. "Solar Lords", "Solar Angels", etc. refer to
such devas as are self-conscious in 45 or 46.
SUPERCONSCIOUS "To the superconscious belong all not yet
self-activated domains of consciousness in the molecular kinds of the individual's
different envelopes. Development consists in self-activating consciousness and thereby to
acquire self-consciousness in these molecular kinds." K 1.22.4
SUPERESSENTIAL SELF, 45-SELF Monad having its highest kind of envelope
and self-consciousness in the superessential world of the solar system. The superessential
self belongs to the fifth natural kingdom.
"As regards consciousness, a 45-self is to a man as a man is to a plant." K
1.35.15
SUPERESSENTIAL WORLD Atomic world 45 in cosmos and the solar system.
Molecular world 45:2-7 in the solar system.
SUPERPHYSICS All reality beyond the physical visible (49:5-7) and
physical-etheric (49:1-4) is superphysical. The lowest superphysical reality is the
emotional (48:1-7).
Only esoterics is able to furnish a superphysics, a science of the superphysical.
Man’s own speculation, clairvoyant "revelations" etc. of that reality have
proved untenable and disorienting.
SUTRATMA (Skt, "thread-soul") The current of energy
connecting the three triads with each other and conveying those higher energies without
which lower envelopes would not be able to exist. The sutratma has its lowest anchorage in
the heart centre of the etheric envelope. When this anchorage is loosened at the end of
incarnation, physical death is definitive.
SYLFS See NATURE-BEING
SYSTEM "is thought’s way of orienting itself. Facts are
largely useless until reason can fit them into their correct relationships (historical,
logical, psychological, or causal ones)." K 1.1.34
SYSTEM THINKING "The highest kind of consciousness in the mental
envelope (47:4) is still inaccessible to mankind. Its manifestations consist in –
among other things – concretization of causal ideas involving simultaneous thinking
by systems instead of concepts." K 1.20.6
T
TELEPATHY "The simplest explanation of telepathy is that all
consciousness is collective and common to all to the extent that they have acquired the
ability to apprehend. We all have a share in the collective consciousness." K 2.9.12
TERTIARY MATTER Evolutionary matter in a first phase with incipient
self-active consciousness. Instances are all matter in the physical world (49:2-7) and,
where higher worlds are concerned, the triad atoms and molecules as well as the matter of
the centres of human envelopes. The self-activity of tertiary matter does not imply
self-consciousness, which is possible only for quaternary matter.
THEOLOGY "Theology lies within the domain of subjective
consciousness, and its dogmas belong to the superphysical. Religion is that feeling,
attraction, which has no need for reason, or at any rate is impaired if it is locked up in
untenable conceptions of reason." K 5.45.1
THEOSOPHY "Theosophy is a summary of facts that used to be
imparted in the esoteric knowledge orders. The term of theosophy came into being when the
term of gnostics has changed because the quasi-gnosticians of the third century A.D. had
begun falsely putting their quasi forward as being esoteric gnostics.
"These are the facts that constitute theosophy. Beyond them, the views of the various
theosophical authors are not theosophy."
"The best summary of the facts of theosophy was made by A. E. Powell in five
volumes."
"The original task of the Theosophical Society was to proclaim universal brotherhood.
Mankind, however, in not yet ripe to realize the principles of tolerance, freedom of
opinion and expression, The Society has split up into several sects, all disputing about
what they believe to be theosophy and which "facts" are hypotheses or facts from
the hierarchy. Their dependence on authority shows that they have not understood, just
believed that they understand.
"The esoteric facts that have been given out after 1920 have not been communicated
through the Theosophical Society." K 6.3.16f,15,18f
THIRD HUMAN TYPE "The third type is the thinker, philosopher,
mathematician (often the unpractical theorist), who examines everything from every side,
etc." K 2.7.11
THIRD SELF Monads having objective self-consciousness in someone of the
three units of the third triad, individuals in the sixth natural kingdom (first divine
kingdom). They are divided into superessential selves (45:1), submanifestal selves (44:1),
and manifestal selves (43:4).
THIRD TRIAD See TRIADS
THOUGHT The monad’s active consciousness in the mental envelope
(47:4-7). There are four ever higher main kinds of thinking: inference thinking, principle
thinking, perspective thinking, system thinking, each one having many subdivisions. (K
1.20.2ff)
THOUGHT, LAW OF "This is this" of the law of identity is also
the fundamental law of the correct perception of reality by thought: let this be this,
such as sense perceives it, in each world separately. (P 1.32.10)
THOUGHT-FORMS When a man thinks, a portion of his mental envelope is
ejected into the surrounding mental world where it immediately assumes a form that is
determined by the content and quality of the thought. (P 2.11.8)
THREE ASPECTS, RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF "The relative significance
of the three aspects to each other is constantly being shifted in the process of
manifestation. In the lower natural kingdoms the matter aspect appears to be the only one.
With each higher kingdom the consciousness aspect grows more and more in significance, so
greatly that the matter aspect (which of course always remains the basis that can never be
lost) comes to seem utterly insignificant. But since with each higher kind of atomic
consciousness the blind omnipotence of dynamis gradually manifests more clearly, the
motion aspect (also called the will aspect) finally comes to predominate." K 2.11.12
THREE ASPECTS OF EXISTENCE
"Existence is a trinity of three equivalent aspects: matter, motion, and
consciousness. None of these three can exist without the other two. All matter has motion
and consciousness." K 1.4.4, 4.1.2
TIME "Time simply means continuation, continued existence. Time is
various ways of measuring motion, various kinds of processes of manifestation. Physical
time is determined by the rotation of the earth and its circling round the sun." K
1.8.5
"Time lacks dimension. Using a line to symbolize time was a failure, a thoroughly
badly chosen simile which has given raise to many misconceptions. Only space has
dimension. Time is that unity which links the past to the present and the future. Time is
durability, continued existence, duration. Objective time is always connected with space
in a succession of events. It is a measure of processes and therefore can be divided into
periods, or time-cycles. Time is both objective and subjective. The cosmos (in primordial
matter) consists of manifestational matter and is that which we can term space in which
all worlds exist. Time is a way of measuring the total process in which all events occur.
Space as well as time can be divided into units however small and, for us, are ways of
measuring and grading."
"The past exists in the present. To a causal self, there is no past of the planetary
atomic worlds 47-49, nor is there to a 43-self of the systemic atomic worlds 43-49."
K 5.36.3,5
TOTAL CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC "Since the ultimate components of the
universe are primordial atoms, cosmic total consciousness is an amalgamation of the
consciousness it all primordial atoms, as the ocean is the union of all drops of
water." K 1.16.2
TRANCE The condition of unconsciousness resulting as the monads
temporarily leaves the envelopes where it has its achieved waking consciousness. Trance
may occur in mediumism or in meditation.
TRANSCENDENT Reaching beyond. Transcendent divinity: se GOD
TRANSFORMATION, LAW OF "All material form (atoms, molecules,
aggregates, worlds, planets, solar systems, aggregates of solar systems, etc.) are subject
to the law of transformation. They are being formed, changed, dissolved, and
re-formed." K 1.31.1
TRANSMIGRATION "The transition of the monads from the mineral to
the vegetable kingdom and thence to the animal and human kingdoms is called
transmigration. It cannot work backwards. Reversion from a higher natural kingdom to a
lower one is absolutely precluded." K 1.33.1
"In order to pass from a lower to a higher natural kingdom, the monad has to learn to
receive and adapt itself to the vibrations from ever higher molecular kinds. At first
these vibrations fulfil the necessary functions of vitalization in the monad’s
envelopes." K 1.33.4
TRIAD (T.B.) Second triad (45:4, 46:1, 47:1).
TRIAD CHAIN The triad chain is composed of three connected triads. Is
also called the monad ladder. (P 2.15)
TRIAD ENVELOPE That lesser part of man’s causal envelope which is
separated at incarnation to enclose the first triad and merges again with the greater
causal envelope at the end of incarnation. Consists of 47:3 matter.
TRIAD UNITS An atom or a molecule composing a triad. The three triads
consist in all of nine triad units. (P 2.15)
TRIADS Permanent triplets of evolutionary atoms
and molecules that accompany the monad, functioning as its instruments during the entire
evolution from the mineral kingdom to the sixth natural kingdom inclusive. During this
entire evolution, the monad has three units.
The firsts triad consists of a mental molecule (47:4), an emotional atom (48:1), and a
physical atom (49:1). The second triad consists of a superessential molecule (45:4), an
essential atom (46:1), and a mental atom (47:1). The third triad consists of a manifestal
molecule (43:4), a submanifestal atom (44:1), and a superessential atom (45:1).
Evolution in the solar system (43-49) is evolution in and through triads. The monad
activates its triads from below. It is always involved in the physical atom of the first
triad. In the animal kingdom, the monad passes to the emotional atom, and in the human
kingdom (at the mental stage) to the mental molecule. The transition to the fifth natural
kingdom implies a transition to second triad mental atom, whereupon the first triad can be
dispensed with. The transition to the sixth natural kingdom implies a transition to the
third triad 45-atom, whereupon the second triad is dispensed with as well. As long as the
second and third triads are inactive, they are held in trust by collective beings
belonging to the deva evolution. (P 2.15f)
TRIMURTI (Skt, T.B.) Trinity. The three aspects motion or power,
consciousness, matter, and also the three kinds of collective beings. In symbolism, Shiva
= the motion aspect, Vishnu = the consciousness aspect, Brahma = the matter aspect.
TRINITY OF EXISTENCE See THREE
ASPECTS OF EXISTENCE
TYPE ACTIVITY "The solar systemic and planetary energies are
always type energies, and the effects they have on the different types in the different
kinds of matter and consciousness differ accordingly. When activity of one type dominates,
it sets it mark on individuals and collectivities in their individual characters. The
result is that every process is to some extent individual and can never again produce
anything exactly similar, never achieve exactly the same result." K 2.13.8
TYPES, DIVISION INTO "The division into types works thoroughly, in
many ways and in innumerable kinds of combinations. Strange as it may seem, every solar
system, every planet, every aggregate expresses one of the seven types especially. Every
individual belongs to one, all man's envelopes can be of different types.
"Individual character also makes itself felt, so that every individual, despite his
type, is something unique, which fact conduces to greater understanding and makes cosmic
unity more fully vibrant." K 2.5.8f
U
ULTIMATE SELF The self-consciousness of the monad.
UNCONSCIOUS "According to esoterics, the unconscious is partly
subconsciousness, partly superconsciousness. The subconscious is the latent memory of past
experiences. The superconscious consists of a long series of domains of consciousness as
yet not conquered." K 6.6.2
UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE "The
understanding of life requires a fund of systematized experiences. This is the foundation
that is acquired during the long process of mental development at the stage of
barbarism." K 5.9.10
UNDINES See NATURE BEING
UNITY, CONSCIOUSNESS OF See ESSENTIAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
UNITY, LAW OF "The law of unity says that all monads make up a
unity and that every monad for superindividual consciousness expansion must realize its
unity with all life." K 1.41.9
UNITY, STAGE OF The essential stage, the first superhuman stage, where
the monad activates consciousness in its essential envelope (46:1-7).
UNIVERSAL MIND (T.B.) Various kinds of collective consciousness in
general, often referring to the planetary collective 46- or 47-consciousness including the
globe memories.
UNIVERSAL SOUL Ancient symbol of the cosmic collective consciousness.
UNMANIFESTED The unmanifested is non-composite matter, thus
non-atomized primordial matter as well as non-involved primordial atoms.
V
VARUNA (Skt, T.B.) Deva raja for world 48.
VEGETABLE KINGDOM The second natural kingdom, or the lowest but one.
"In this kingdom the monad acquires the ability to distinguish between attractive and
repulsive vibrations, thereby having achieved contact with the emotional world (48:7).
Vegetable monads develop most quickly by being consumed by animals and men, thereby being
subjected to the strong vibrations in their emotional envelopes. By learning to perceive
these vibrations they become able gradually to attain higher levels in their
kingdom." K 1.33.6
VEGETABLE MONAD The monad during its evolution in the vegetable kingdom
is called vegetable monad.
"When the mineral monads have succeeded in acquiring physical etheric consciousness,
they pass to the vegetable kingdom. Consciousness first manifests itself as a tendency to
repetition, becoming a tendency to organized habit, or ‘nature’. When
consciousness is increased, there arises a striving after adaptation. The vegetable monads
become animal monads through acquiring emotional consciousness." K 4.8.3
"The vegetable monads develop through the plants being devoured by animals and men
and in this being subjected to the forceful emotional vibrations in these animal
bodies." K 4.11.5
VIBRATIONS "are the result of higher kinds of matter penetrating
lower kinds. This fact has given rise to the idea that everything consists of
vibrations." K 1.27.2 (K 7.16.11)
VISHNU (Skt, T.B.) One of the "persons" in Trimurti. Symbol
of the consciousness aspect and its kinds of collective beings. Deva raja of world 44.
VISHUDDHA-CHAKRA (Skt, T.)
VISIBLE WORLD Molecular world, the three lower states of aggregation of
the physical world (49:5-7).
The visible world can be said to be the special world of minerals as regards
consciousness. (K 1.11.5)
Man’s envelope in the physical world, when he is incarnated in it, is the organism
(49:5-7). (K 1.14.1)
VITAL FORCE in the organism "depends on five different kinds of
etheric energies replacing one another at twenty-four minute intervals, thus recurring
periodically at intervals of two hours." K 2.12.7
W
WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS "In his organism man’s waking
consciousness consists of sense perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and manifestations of the
will."
"Waking consciousness is thus a tiny fraction of the monad's possibility of
consciousness." K 1.22.2,6
Opposite: unconscious.
WILL "The will is dynamis acting through active consciousness.
Active consciousness is thus the ability of consciousness to let dynamis act through it.
The ‘will’ is energy’s individualized mode of acting through consciousness,
in doing which the essential things for ever higher kinds of worlds are the consciousness
content's accordance with law, accordance with plan, purposefulness, one-pointedness of
purpose." K 1.28.1
There are as many kinds of will as there are kinds of active consciousness.
"The different kinds of will are acquired simultaneously with full subjective and
objective self-consciousness in the respective worlds, or with the self's ability of
centring itself in the pertaining envelopes." K 1.29.2
"Physically, man’s "will" is vitality and ability of activity;
emotionally, attraction and repulsion; mentally, motive (usually motive for action)
adhered to."
"Will is determined by motives and that the strongest motive will win." K 7.6.6f
WILL (T.B.) "Originally, the will was the symbolic term for the
motion aspect (the will aspect)."
"Will meant the ability of consciousness to let dynamis act through it. The higher
the kind of consciousness, the greater the possibility of dynamis. The highest
consciousness is also the highest ‘power’.
"In their apparently hopeless lack of terms esoteric authors have used
‘will’ for the highest kind of consciousness in both the fifth and sixth natural
kingdoms, thus for both 45- and 43-consciousness." K 7.6.2,4f
WILL TO UNITY "The will to unity is no will to uniformity, no
standardization into robotism. The will to unity does not fight against other views or
against dissidents. It is so rational that it need never fear criticism. It leaves
everybody’s fiction in peace, for it knows how to find unity in diversity. The
individual has a natural right to exist, to be different from all others, to be an
individual with individuality. In its deepest sense, freedom is individuality. Without
freedom there is no individual character, no self-reliance, no self-determination, no
development. The will to unity is the strongest defence of freedom, for this will must be
built on freedom as its basis..." "The will to unity is the only rational basis,
and the only basis tenable in the end, of society and of culture. That idea is the basic
idea of this book.
"The will to unity is not least the will to a national culture. Such a culture must
emerge from that collective self-reliance and self-determination which the will to unity
fosters in a nation." P 1.1.3,7f
WORKING HYPOTHESIS A hypothesis, an assumption you use for practical
reasons, until you can replace it with ascertained facts.
"At mankind’s present stage of development, esoteric knowledge cannot be more
than a working hypothesis where most people are concerned. But the further mankind
develops, the more obvious its incomparable superiority will become." K 1.1.33,
4.11.8
WORLD, LORD OF THE (Skt, T.) The planetary ruler, head of the planetary
government. His name is Sanat Kumara.
WORLD CONSCIOUSNESS See ATOMIC
CONSCIOUSNESS
WORLD TEACHER, THE (T.B.) The head of the
second department of the planetary hierarchy (department of education). The same as
bodhisattva. The present holder of the office is 43-self Christos-Maitreya. (K 3.1.28)
WORLD VIEW "The world view is our total knowledge of the matter
aspect of reality. The world view includes the physical and natural sciences and their
offshoots."
"Without a world view, a knowledge of reality, the necessary basis of life view is
lacking. A rational conception of reality is all the more important since the life view is
of fundamental, indispensable importance." P 3.1.1f
WORLD VIEW AND LIFE VIEW "The thinking man wishing to obtain a
conception of existence acquires a world view as regards external objective material
reality and a life view as to emotional and mental life belonging to internal, subjective
consciousness." K 5.40.1
WORLDS See MATERIAL WORLDS
Y
YOGA "The original yoga methods were elaborated by
‘rishis’ in Lemuria and Atlantis..." "Of the five methods of
development most widely known, two are direct: physical hatha yoga (a risky forcing-house
method that has claimed countless victims) and mental raja yoga. Three are indirect: gnana
yoga (development of reason), bhakti yoga (ennoblement of emotion), and karma yoga
(devoted service)." K 6.5.1f
"Yoga can be most simply defined as the striving to activate physical, emotional, and
mental consciousness." K 7.15.2
YUGA (Skt, T.) Time-period of varying length. There are four kinds of
yuga corresponding to the gold, silver, copper and iron ages in Western mythology: Satya
yuga (1 728 000 years), Treta yuga (1 296 000 years), Dvapara yuga (864 000 years), and
Kali yuga (432 000 years). A complete cycle from Satya yuga through Kali yuga (4,32
million years) is called a Maha yuga.
Z
ZODIACAL PERIOD Esoterically, the cultural development of mankind is
not continuous but discontinuous-cyclical. It is divided into 12 zodiacal periods of some
2500 years each. In the year 1950 began the zodiacal period of Aquarius as the vernal
equinox entered into the zodiacal constellation of Aquarius.
