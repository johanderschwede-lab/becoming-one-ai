  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ever since 1984 the Institute for Hylozoic Studies has worked to
  promote the study of the esoteric knowledge of life, especially in its Western, hylozoic
  (Pythagorean) form. At the very outset of our work, the publishing of an esoteric
  vocabulary appeared particularly desirable, not least in order to counteract the confusion
  of ideas prevalent in this sphere. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without any claims whatever to treat of the subject-matter in its
  entire depth or to describe exhaustively its terminology, the Institute in December 1986
  published the first Swedish edition of the present work to the Scandinavian readers. After
  this first edition ran out of print 1991, the work at a new edition was begun, and in 1996
  this second edition was published. The present English edition is a translation of the
  1996 Swedish edition.</p>
  <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#Go To">The Esoteric Dictionary</a> </i>is primarily an
  inventory of the terminology used by Henry T. Laurency, secondarily of the terminology
  used in theosophy and the works of Alice A. Bailey. The <i>Dictionary</i> is intended to
  be more than a mere vocabulary. It contains more than 500 entries, the majority of which
  besides definitions of the terms also cite excerpts from <a href="ContKR.htm"><i>The
  Knowledge of Reality</i></a> and <a href="ContPS.htm"><i>The Philosopher&#146;s Stone</i></a>
  by Henry T. Laurency, <i>The Knowledge of Reality</i> in particular, since it is the more
  important book where the elementary study is concerned. Actually, the main body of the
  text of the dictionary is made up of such excerpts. When compiling this Dictionary, the
  selection of terms to be entered as well as the formulation of the texts appended to them
  was made with a view to presenting esoteric students with a practical tool that they would
  find interesting enough to study as a work in its own right, beside the works of Laurency.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References to the works of Laurency are given using the same method as
  is consistently used in the Internet edition of his works; that is, not by pages, but by
  sections, chapters, and paragraphs. This has been sufficiently explained on the Official
  Website of the Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation (<a href="introduc.htm">Introduction
  to the works of Henry T. Laurency</a>).</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References between entries are not very numerous. From an educational
  point of view, it should prove more expedient that the students go through the Dictionary
  several times over and so doing discover for themselves the natural, logical connections
  there are between the entries.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attention of the students is called to the fact that one and the
  same entry sometimes is explained twice, as a Laurency term and as a theosophical and/or
  Bailey term. MONAD and TRIAD are two such instances where the same terms have different
  meanings in different authors. Esoteric students who study both Laurency and
  theosophy/Bailey will appreciate the necessity of making such distinctions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <i>Esoteric Dictionary</i> can be used by both beginners and more
  advanced students to study hylozoics in a new and interesting way. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><br>
  Abbreviations used in the Dictionary</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">K = <i>The Knowledge of Reality</i><br>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quotations from Laurency are surrounded by quotation marks.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If several continuous paragraphs are quoted, a quotation mark is put at
  the beginning of each paragraph but only at the end of the last one.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every quotation is accompanied by a reference, for example K 1.2.15,
  which means that the quotation is from <i>The Knowledge of Reality</i>, section <i>The
  Problems of Reality, Part One</i>, chapter two, paragraph 15.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In cases where the information given is taken from a Laurency text that
  is not literally quoted, this is shown by putting the reference in brackets (K 1.2.15).</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Texts not presented in quotes are written by me.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Needless to say, I am very grateful to receive suggestions from
  students and other readers as to possible improvements or additions. </p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVATION, LAW OF &quot;The law of activation says that individual
  development is possible only through self-initiated consciousness activity.&quot; K
  1.41.14<br>
  &quot;All development is the result of work and toil.&quot; P 3.23.2</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVATION AND OBJECTIVATION, METHODS OF Methods to activate higher, as
  yet inactive consciousness, and to make subjective (emotional and mental) consciousness
  objective. &quot;Those esoteric methods, which lead rapidly and without risks to causal
  objective consciousness, remain the property of the planetary hierarchy.&quot; K 6.8.6<br>
  &quot;Unlike the yogis&#146; methods of activation, the esoteric one is a methodical and
  systematical activation of passive consciousness in one after the other of up to then
  superconscious molecular kinds. This is done by vitalizing the different chakras of the
  different envelopes. Consciousness in each molecular kind is bound up with its particular
  chakra. When a chakra is vitalized, subjective consciousness in that molecular kind
  ensues. Objective consciousness is obtained by the subjective consciousness in the chakra
  activating that molecular kind in the envelope. As has already been pointed out, only the
  causal self can use emotional and mental objective consciousness correctly. Until then,
  the individual will be the victim of his own ignorance and will retard his higher
  development.&quot; K 7.22.3<br>
  &quot;In each new incarnation the individual in his new envelopes has to repeat the whole
  process of activation. If the individual has once received the knowledge and has not
  abused it, he will be given occasions to remember his old knowledge anew in new
  lives.&quot; K 7.22.10</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS &quot;Consciousness activation in the three
  lowest natural kingdoms is an unconscious and automatic process which gradually becomes a
  conscious one in the human kingdom. In higher kingdoms it is the result of self-initiated
  consciousness activity.&quot; K 1.28.4</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="ACTIVATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SYSTEMATIC">A</a>CTIVATION OF
  CONSCIOUSNESS, SYSTEMATIC Systematic activation of consciousness is done in four steps:
  concentration, meditation, contemplation and illumination.<br>
  &quot;Concentration is the keeping of attention on a certain thing. Meditation implies a
  concentrated analysis of all relations pertaining to this subject-matter. Contemplation
  entails the isolation of the problem until one begins to see the idea and can concentrate
  attention on that single point. If thereby activity ceases, there is a risk of falling
  asleep or into ordinary trance. If activity can be kept up long enough, illumination comes
  and the individual will find what he has been seeking.&quot; K 7.17.9</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS The self-active consciousness that becomes
  possible through evolution. Having active consciousness the monads themselves initiate
  their consciousness expressions.<br>
  In the vegetable and animal kingdoms this activation occurs in groups (through
  group-souls). In the human kingdom consciousness becomes more and more self-active.<br>
  &quot;Active consciousness is the ability of consciousness to let dynamis act through
  it.&quot; K 1.28.1<br>
  &quot;The expressions of active consciousness induce matter to act as energy.&quot; K
  1.28.2</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTUALIZED CONSCIOUSNESS Awakened, functioning consciousness.<br>
  &quot;The monad's potential consciousness is awakened to life (is actualized) in the
  cosmos.&quot; K 1.15.2<br>
  Actualized consciousness goes through different degrees of activation: passive, active,
  self-active.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ADEPT Esoteric master, 45-self.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ADI (Skt, T.B.) World 43 and its consciousness.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGGREGATE ENVELOPES All forms of nature are envelopes for monads. All
  forms except organisms of the physical world are aggregate envelopes, molecules of the
  kinds of matter of the respective worlds held together electro-magnetically. (K 1.13.2)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGGREGATION, STATES OF Same as molecular kinds.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGNI (Skt, T.B.) Deva raja of world 47. Symbol of the causal-mental
  world.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGNICHAITANS (Skt, T.B.) Building devas of the physical eterical world.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGNISHVATTAS (Skt, T.B.) Building devas of the causal-mental world.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGNISURYANS (Skt, T.B.) Building devas of the emotional world.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AGNOSTIC One who denies the possibility of ascertaining superphysical
  facts. (K 1.2.15)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AJNA-CHAKRA (Skt, T.B.) Eyebrow centre.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AKASHA (Skt, T.) World 44 in the solar system.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;AKASHIC RECORDS&quot; (Q.) Such globe memories as can be reached
  with emotional clairvoyance (48:4-7). They do not contain the past of the planet, but what
  people in all times have believed about this past. The real akasha, the akasha of the
  planetary hierarchy, is world 44. (K 6.9)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANAHATA-CHAKRA (Skt, T.B.) Heart centre.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANANKE (Gr.) Necessity. Result of the activity of eternal, mechanical
  laws of nature.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANGELS The gnostic and later also Christian term of devas. The
  archangels are the seven highest devas of our planet (43-selves) who preside over their
  respective departments in the deva hierarchy. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIMA MUNDI (Lat.) The &quot;soul of the world&quot;, older esoteric
  term meaning the collective consciousness in 46&#150;49.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIMAL KINGDOM The third natural kingdom of evolution. In the animal
  kingdom the monads have principally physical and emotional consciousness. Between
  incarnations they are enclosed in common envelopes of mental matter, so-called
  group-souls. &quot;The higher up the scale of evolution an animal is, the fewer are the
  monads that go to its group.&quot; K 1.33.6<br>
  &quot;When the monad has been able for a long time to be affected by mental vibrations
  (47:7) and has thus attained the highest animal species, it becomes possible for it to
  transmigrate to the human kingdom.&quot; K 1.33.10</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIMAL MONAD During its evolution in the animal kingdom the monad is
  called animal monad.<br>
  &quot;The vegetable monads become animal monads through acquiring emotional consciousness.
  When their mental consciousness is sufficiently active, the animal monads pass to the
  human kingdom.&quot; K 4.8.3<br>
  &quot;Having developed so as to acquire an envelope of its own in the causal world, the
  animal monad transmigrates to the human kingdom.&quot; K 4.8.4</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANTAHKARANA (Skt: &quot;the inner organ&quot;, T.B.) That channel for
  energy and consciousness which the evolutionary monad builds through its own activity
  between its triad units and envelopes as a ladder to climb up to ever higher consciousness
  and ability. The antahkarana has its lowest anchorage in the crown centre of the etheric
  envelope. (K 7.3.15) </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANTIMETAPHYSICIAN Denier of the existence of superphysical reality.
  (K&nbsp;1.2.15)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANUPADAKA (Skt, T.B.) World 44 and its consciousness. Synonyms: akasha,
  paranirvana.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PRIORI (Lat.) In advance, i.e. without prior investigation or
  experience. Opposite: a posteriori = afterwards, after investigation or experience.<br>
  &quot;The correct explanation of the aprioristic in our apprehension was given long ago by
  Platon. According to him, there is another kind of certainty than that of ordinary
  experience. This certainty is the outcome of remembering anew concepts acquired in
  previous incarnations. Everything aprioristic is thus obtained ultimately from
  experience.&quot; K 5.28.14</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARHAT (Skt, T.B.) 46-self, initiate of the 4th degree.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARUPA (Skt &quot;without form&quot;, T.B.) All matter above 47:4 is
  said to be without form, although all matter has form. In a restricted sense and most
  often arupa means 47:1-3, the causal world and its kinds of matter; arupa devas are causal
  devas.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCENDING ARC (T.) Has two meanings:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Evolution in general.<br>
    2. The three last globe periods in an eon.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASEKHA (Pali: one trained to completion, T.) Esoteric master, perfected
  45-self, initiate of the 5th degree.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASHRAM (Skt, T.B.) That group which a member of the planetary hierarchy
  (at least a 46-self) forms of his disciples and with himself as the focus in the
  &quot;power house&quot;. The planetary hierarchy consists of seven greater ashrams led by
  44-selves and representing the seven departments, and 42 lesser ones led by 45- and
  46-selves. The type energies these collective beings emit encompass the planet. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASTRAL BODY, WORLD etc. (T.B.) The same as emotional envelope, world
  etc. However, in Blavatsky&#146;s terminology, &quot;astral&quot; also means the etheric
  (49:1-4). (K 3.3.25, 3.5.7)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASTROLOGY, ESOTERIC &quot;The knowledge of the relations of our solar
  system and our planet to other solar systems, of the exchange of interstellar and
  interplanetary energies, once was one of the most important sciences in mankind's
  possession. The people that got farthest in this respect were the Chaldeans of some 30 000
  years ago. Fortunately, we can look forward to the time when the individuals who acquired
  this knowledge in Chaldea will incarnate again and once more present mankind with the
  esoteric &#145;astrology&#146;, thereby reviving the long-lost knowledge.&quot;
  K&nbsp;2.13.11</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASTROLOGY, EXOTERIC &quot;Exoteric astrology is not exact. It still
  lacks the knowledge of a number of necessary facts. Even with its twelve zodiacal types
  and seven planetary types to guide it, it still cannot state their relations to the
  existing types. It cannot interpret all the possibilities of the horoscope. It knows
  nothing about the horoscope of more than one of the individual's five envelopes.<br>
  &quot;The fate of astrology is one of many examples of what will happen when esoteric
  knowledge gets into the hands of the uninitiated... The result is superstition of a more
  or less gross kind.&quot; K 2.13.13f</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATLANTIS Hemispherical continent and abode of the fourth root-race. It
  was situated at the present location of the Atlantic and North America and was submerged
  into the ocean in four stages: 800 000, 200 000, 75 025 and 9564 BC.<br>
  &quot;The Atlanteans were physicalists of repulsive emotionality.&quot; K&nbsp;6.5.7</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATMA (Skt, T.B.) World 45 and its consciousness, 45-envelope of the
  second self.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOM &quot;Atoms are composed of primordial atoms. The lower the atomic
  kind, the more primordial atoms enter into the atom.&quot; K 1.10.2<br>
  &quot;There are two kinds of atoms: negative and positive. In the negative (receptive)
  atoms, material energy flows from a higher atomic kind to a lower; in the positive
  (propulsive) atoms, from a lower to a higher. This current is the force that maintains the
  atoms, molecules, material aggregates, in their given forms.&quot; K 1.27.1</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOM OF SCIENCE &quot;The chemical so-called atom of science is a
  physical etheric molecule (49:4). This molecular kind, like all other molecular kinds,
  contains 49 different layers of matter. To reach the real physical atom (49:1), the
  nuclear physicists have to work their way through 147 layers of matter, each in succession
  higher than the other. No physical science will achieve that.&quot; K&nbsp;1.10.8</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="ATOMIC CONSCIOUSNESS">A</a>TOMIC CONSCIOUSNESS &quot;Atomic
  consciousness is world consciousness. The individual as a joint owner of a consciousness
  collective is like a cell in an organism. The organism is an envelope of an individual in
  a higher kingdom. When in the collective consciousness of his world the individual has so
  developed that he can take over this material world as an envelope of his own, then he
  will be a &#145;god&#146; of this world.<br>
  &quot;Atomic consciousness, world consciousness, omniscience (in that world) does not mean
  that the individual knows everything about everything that is or happens. But it is
  possible for him to find out more or less quickly everything he wishes to know,
  independently of space and past time in a given world, to ascertain all relations in the
  three aspects (matter, motion, and consciousness) of that world.&quot; K 1.30.6f</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOMIC ENERGIES The effect of dynamis through the 49 atomic kinds. <br>
  &quot;The atomic energies act from world to world through the atomic kinds&quot; K 1.29.3 </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOMIC MATTER Primordial atoms and matter composed of it is called
  atomic matter in contrast to primordial matter. There exist 49 different kinds of atomic
  matter called atomic kinds.<br>
  &quot;Atomic matter is by nature dynamic.&quot; K 1.7.4</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOMIC MEMORY The collective memory of all atoms in the respective
  worlds.<br>
  &quot;Only the collective atomic memory of the emotional world is the one that cannot be
  falsified, but reproduces exactly past events of the emotional and physical worlds, but
  not those of higher worlds.&quot; K 6.9.4</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOMIC KINDS &quot;The cosmos consists of primordial atoms (called
  monads by Pythagoras) which are composed to make 49 kinds of atoms, each in succession
  coarser than the previous ones, in seven continuous series of seven atomic kinds in each.
  These atomic kinds make up the 49 cosmic worlds.<br>
  &quot;Each lower atomic kind is formed out of the next higher one (2 out of 1, 3 out of 2,
  4 out of 3, etc.). The lowest atomic kind (49) thus contains all the 48 higher kinds. When
  an atomic kind is dissolved, the next higher kind is obtained; out of the physical atom
  are obtained 49 atoms of atomic kind 48.&quot; K 1.7.1f<br>
  &quot;Each atomic kind has its own dimension.&quot; K 1.8.4</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATOMIZED MANIFESTATIONAL MATTER Matter consisting of the cosmic kinds
  of matter 1&#150;49, contrary to the homogeneous primordial matter. (P 2.60.1)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ATTRACTION Attraction characterizes the vibrations of the three higher
  kinds of emotional matter (48:2-4). The pertaining consciousness is by the individual
  perceived as noble feelings. (K 1.19.5, P 2.31.4ff)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AUGOEIDES (Gr.) Pythagorean term of a certain category of devas who are
  46- and 45-selves. They make up collective beings and have tasks closely connected with
  the evolution of our mankind. Among other tasks they administer the execution of the law
  of destiny in mankind and take care of men&#146;s second triads as long as these are
  inactive. Man&#146;s (greater) causal envelope is a gift from Augoeides.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AURA Man&#146;s emotional, mental, and causal envelopes &quot;embrace
  and penetrate all the lower ones. They are oval in shape and extend between 30 and 45 cm
  beyond the organism, making the so-called aura. Approximately 99 per cent of the matter of
  these envelopes is attracted to the organism and is held together within its periphery, so
  that the aggregate envelopes form complete replicas of the former.&quot; K 4.9.1</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AUTOMATIZATION The monad reaches the highest level of consciousness
  (objective self-consciousness) in a kind of matter when it completely dominates the
  corresponding envelope of the monad and its consciousness functions have been taken over
  by the next higher envelope through automatization. (P 2.27.5, 2.41.5)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AVATAR (Skt) Higher being, 45-self or even higher self, incarnating in
  mankind to assist us.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BARBARISM, STAGE OF The first or lowest of man&#146;s five stages of
  development. It is characterized by the fact that physical and the repulsive emotional
  consciousness are the most important.<br>
  &quot;The individual at the stage of barbarism as a physical self only, without emotional
  and mental consciousness worth mentioning, belongs on the very lowest levels of the stage
  of barbarism. Immediately after causalization he is little more than an animal, often not
  even so intelligent.&quot; K 1.34.12<br>
  So primitive men do not incarnate in our humanity any longer. Even the least developed
  have at least 30 000 incarnations in the human kingdom, yet they are at the stage of
  barbarism.<br>
  &quot;On the higher levels of the stage of barbarism, his mental consciousness is
  activated to the extent that he is able to draw simple conclusions.&quot; K 1.34.12</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BASIC TENDENCIES OF INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER &quot;In every individual
  character two basic tendencies can be discerned, which pervade all nature; the opposition
  of positive and negative, active and passive, attractive and repellent. One of the two
  tendencies preponderates in every individual. In some, either tendency is driven to
  extremes.&quot; P 3.48.7<br>
  &quot;Development in monads of repulsive basic tendency can take a wrong course, this
  showing already in parasitism of plants and in predacity of animals.&quot; K 4.11.4</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BEING &quot;&#145;Being&#146; bears on the consciousness aspect. All
  material forms with a unitary consciousness are beings.&quot; P 2.11.2<br>
  Individual beings (monads) and collective beings (composed of monads) are distinguished.
  Viewed individually, the monad&#146;s material envelopes are beings. Man consists of five
  beings, which it is the monad&#146;s task to control.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BELIEF &quot;is absolute, unreasonable emotional conviction, unamenable
  to correction or reason. Everybody has his petty beliefs about almost any absurdity, and
  this is because man is unable to truly know anything but definitively established facts in
  the visible world. In contrast, assumption, is preliminary, valid only until one has come
  to know, in amenable to rational arguments, and desires correction.&quot; K 1.2.11</p>

  only for those who have developed so far ahead of the rest of mankind that they can
  purposefully prepare for their transition to the next higher kingdom. They have acquired
  the ability to associate with everybody in the causal world, the meeting-place for the

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CAUSAL ENVELOPE The monad&#146;s envelope of causal matter (47:1-3).
  The causal envelope is the only envelope that is permanent throughout the monad&#146;s
  sojourn in the human kingdom. It was acquired at the monad&#146;s transition from the
  animal to the human kingdom. It is the causal envelope that incarnates, together with
  human monad, which it always encloses, into four lower envelopes, which are soon
  dissolved. (K 1.14.2, 1.34.2, 4.8.4)<br>
  The causal envelope &quot;retains the memory of all the human incarnations and of the
  experiences had, of insight and understanding gained, of qualities and abilities
  acquired.&quot; K 1.34.35<br>
  &quot;During incarnation the first self has two causal bodies. This condition lasts until
  the monad becomes a causal self. At the time of involvation the causal body is divided
  into two. The greater part, serving as a collector of matter supplied, remains in the
  causal world. The smaller world (the triad envelope), containing the lowest triad,
  encloses the lower bodies. When the involvation of the first self is concluded and the
  personality is dissolved, the two separate parts amalgamate to form one single causal
  body. The four centres of the causal body do not belong to the involving triad envelope.
  It is these two causal bodies that have been called the &#145;twin souls&#146; and have
  occasioned fantasies of all sorts.&quot; P 2.23.6</p>

  will last until the time comes for rebirth and an embryo has been formed for him in a
  physical maternal body... There can be no conscious causal life unless the intuition of
  the causal ideas has been acquired in physical existence... The monad&#146;s continuity of

  &quot;Of the chakras in the causal envelope of the &#145;normal individual', which form a
  lotus-like organ, only those three are slightly developed which during incarnations are in
  contact with the heart and crown chakras of the etheric, emotional, and mental envelopes.<br>
  &quot;Normally, the throat chakra is developed at the stage of civilization, the heart
  chakra at the stage of culture, the eyebrow chakra at the stage of humanity, and the crown

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">COLLECTIVE BEINGS In all natural kingdoms the monads form collective
  beings. In the three subhuman kingdoms, non-self-conscious monads form group-souls. In the
  human kingdom, the development of self-consciousness becomes the essential purpose, and so
  man&#146;s consciousness of the collective beings he is part of (groups, clans, etc.)
  remains passive (according to the law of separation). In the superhuman kingdoms, the
  monad, with its self-consciousness preserved, enters into ever larger collectives and has
  common consciousness with the monads entering into them.<br>
  &quot;Every world, every planet, solar system, etc., thus has its own collective
  consciousness, and constitutes a unitary collective being having one monad as the superior
  dominant. The higher the kingdom attained by the monad, the greater its participation in
  the cosmic total consciousness. When the monad has acquired planetary consciousness it is
  a planetary being. When, finally, it has actualized its potential universal consciousness,
  it has become an individual unit in cosmic omniscience and omnipotence.&quot; K 4.7.3</p>

  aspect, the consciousness aspect, and the will aspect. Accordingly we have formers of
  matter, supervisors of evolution, and restorers of balance.&quot; P&nbsp;2.52.1</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS &quot;All consciousness is at the same time
  collective consciousness. This is so because there is no personal isolation, although only
  those who have acquired essential consciousness (46) can live in the collective
  consciousness.<br>
  &quot;There are innumerable kinds of collective consciousness: atomic, molecular,
  aggregate, world, planetary, systemic, and after these, different kinds of cosmic
  consciousness. The higher the kingdom attained by the monad, the more is embraced by the
  collective consciousness in which the self, with its self-consciousness preserved,
  experiences other selves as its own larger self.<br>
  &quot;Or, to put it differently, all consciousness in the whole cosmos constitutes a
  common, inevitable, indivisible unity in which every individual has a smaller or greater
  part, depending on the level of development he has attained.&quot; K 1.16.3ff<br>
  &quot;The collective consciousness is the primary and common one; the individual
  self-consciousness the individual must acquire by himself throughout ever higher natural
  kingdoms, this being possible because of his very participation in the collective
  consciousness.&quot; K 2.4.2<br>

  ever more active in the ever higher worlds of ever higher natural kingdoms.<br>
  The most important insight about the nature of consciousness is that all consciousness is
  simultaneously collective consciousness. (K 1.16.3)<br>
  &quot;There is only one consciousness is the cosmos, the cosmic total consciousness, of
  which every monad has an inalienable part. This consciousness is an amalgamation of the

  emotional and mental envelopes have their correspondences in a cluster of atoms (Sanskrit:
  skandhas), are preserved by the causal envelope, and used at reincarnation. It is the task
  of the self to learn to master its envelopes, so that they submit to its will. This is no
  easy task, since the tendencies of the envelopes are the result of habits from thousands
  of incarnations. At mankind&#146;s present stage of development, the emotional controls

  Consciousness of the monad, in the emotional envelope (48:2-7).<br>
  &quot;By nature emotional consciousness is exclusively desire, or what the individual at
  the emotional stage perceives as dynamic will. At the stage of barbarism, before the
  individual&#146;s consciousness in the mental envelope has been activated, desire is
  manifested as more or less uncontrolled impulses. When the mental envelope, influenced by
  the vibrations of the emotional envelope, is attracted to and woven together with the
  emotional envelope, mental consciousness is awakened to life, and desire and thought
  merge. If desire then preponderates, there ensues feeling, which is desire coloured with
  thought. If thought preponderates, imagination ensues, which is thought coloured with
  desire.<br>
  &quot;Man's emotional life is in the main the life of emotional illusions. He is the
  victim of desire's wishful thinking, of the illusions of emotional thinking. The
  individual is completely free of the illusions of only after he has acquired causal
  consciousness.<br>
  &quot;The vibrations of the three lower emotional molecular kinds are largely repellent,
  the three higher, attractive. Noble feelings are manifestations of attraction.&quot; K

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EMOTIONAL CULTURE &quot;The stage of emotional culture has been reached
  when everybody serves and nobody feels like a master. When everybody serves something
  higher, something beyond himself, something for several, for many, for all together, then
  that harmony will present itself which is the expression of cultured emotion. The present
  intellectual possibilities of man have been overrated, and his emotional ones undervalued

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EMOTIONAL ENVELOPE The monad&#146;s envelope of emotional matter
  (48:2-7). In the mineral and vegetable kingdom the emotional envelope belongs to the
  group-soul; in the animal and human kingdoms the monad has an individual emotional
  envelope. The emotional envelope is the seat of desires. In the human kingdom, when the
  mental envelope is activated, the emotional envelope coalesces with the mental so that the
  two make up, from the functional point of view, one envelope. Through this originate the
  two emotional-mental kinds of consciousness: feeling and imagination.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EMOTIONAL EON Current eon of our planet (lasting 4320 million years).
  It is chiefly intended to activate emotional consciousness.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EMOTIONAL LIFE BETWEEN INCARNATIONS &quot;Man&#146;s life in the
  emotional world can prove completely different for different individuals, depending on
  their developmental level.<br>
  &quot;Like the physical world, the emotional world has six successively higher regions.
  Most people are nowadays objectively conscious from the beginning in the three regions
  (48:5-7) that correspond to the three lowest regions of the physical world (49:5-7)...
  Objects in those regions are material counterparts of the material forms of the physical
  world, which fact often causes the newcomer to think that he still lives in the physical
  world.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The emotional envelope dissolves gradually: first its lowest molecular kind, then
  the lowest but one, etc. When the three lowest are dissolved it is not possible for the
  individual to contact the visible physical world.&quot;<br>
  &quot;In the three higher regions of the emotional world, the existing material forms are
  imaginative formations made by the individuals in those regions. For emotional matter
  forms itself in accordance with the slightest hint from consciousness, the ignorant
  neither understanding the cause nor being able to grasp how it happened. The individual
  seldom learns anything really new while in the emotional world and in the mental world
  never.<br>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EMOTIONAL STAGE &quot;As an emotional self (at the stages of
  civilization and culture), the individual is in his thinking and acting determined by
  emotional motives. The emotional stage is the most difficult stage of development. Man
  must by himself acquire consciousness in all six molecular kinds of his emotional envelope
  and in the two lowest of his mental envelope. To the emotional stage belongs almost
  everything that man today regards as civilization and culture.&quot; K 1.34.13</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EMOTIONAL THINKING &quot;At his present stage of development, man is an
  emotional being with a possibility of intermittent use of his still undeveloped reason.<br>
  &quot;Sense perception excepted, emotionality can be said to include everything
  psychological that does not belong to the purely rational, and the purely rational does
  not embrace much. Our consciousness is centred in emotionality, which colours sense
  perceptions as well as thoughts. Our consciousness is centred in emotionality, which

  &quot;What one gets to know in the emotional world is not the knowledge of existence,
  reality, and life. Like the mental world, it is intended to be a sojourn for rest pending
  a new incarnation. It is only in the physical and causal worlds that man is able to
  ascertain real facts, not in the emotional and mental worlds. In these worlds one cannot
  know whether what one sees is nature's enduring reality or not.<br>

  collective consciousness of its different molecules.&quot; K 1.23.1<br>
  &quot;The self develops in and through envelopes, from the lowest physical etheric
  envelope to the highest cosmic world. It constantly acquires new envelopes in one world
  after another. Step by step it acquires self-consciousness in the ever higher molecular

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ESOTERIC HISTORY BEFORE 1875 &quot;Members of this planetary hierarchy
  incarnated in mankind, eventually to make up what in the esoteric history has been called
  the &#145;higher priesthood&#146;. This happened in Lemuria. As soon as consciousness had
  developed sufficiently for men to be able to learn, they were given such necessary
  instruction and knowledge of reality as they were able to grasp. In both Lemuria and
  Atlantis, temple schools were set up in which the human √©lite were given the education
  suited to their ability to comprehend... The √©lite were trained to be teachers of the
  rest of mankind, eventually to form the &#145;lower priesthood&#146;.&quot;<br>
  Later, a large part of the &quot;lower priesthood&quot;, who had acquired a knowledge of
  magic, rebelled against the &quot;higher priesthood&quot;. The planetary hierarchy was
  banished first in Lemuria, later in Atlantis.<br>
  &quot;Abuse of knowledge leads to the loss of knowledge, and ever since the planetary
  hierarchy was driven out of Atlantis mankind has had to &#145;look after its own
  affairs&#146;.&quot;<br>
  &quot;However, not everybody took part in the black priesthood's revolt against the higher
  priesthood. Those individuals who had reached the stage of culture, and who were on the
  side of good, did not forfeit the right to remember anew their old knowledge. For their
  benefit the planetary hierarchy instituted secret knowledge orders among all nations that
  had reached such a stage of development that cultural individuals could incarnate among
  them.&quot;<br>
  The planetary hierarchy made two attempts to awaken man to see the rationality of life and
  to counteract the dreadful hatred between men&#133; In India Buddha incarnated to try and
  impress the people with what has been called the &quot;religion of wisdom&quot;. And
  Christos incarnated to awaken people to understand what has been called the &quot;religion
  of love&quot;. <br>
  &quot;As we know, both attempts failed. Buddha&#146;s disciples were driven out of India,
  and Christos&#146; message of love was taken care of by individuals who had belonged to
  the black priesthood of Atlantis.<br>
  &quot;The planetary hierarchy had no other choice but to continue instituting new
  knowledge orders, as for the rest trying to vitalize men&#146;s emotional and mental
  consciousness, so that these could develop into greater understanding of reality.&quot;<br>
  By the year 1775 mankind had reaped the last of its bad sowing from Atlantis. &quot;The
  knowledge of reality could thus in that respect be permitted to become common
  property&quot;... &quot;The problem of how mankind, totally disoriented, was best to
  assimilate the knowledge had long been under discussion in the planetary hierarchy, and
  vast preparations had been made.&quot;<br>
  &quot;It was at the conclave of the planetary hierarchy in 1775 that two of its members
  (the then 45-selves M. and K.H.) offered to take immediate steps to publicize some part of
  the knowledge of the consciousness and matter aspects of existence which hitherto had been
  imparted in the esoteric knowledge orders.&quot;<br>
  &quot;All the other members of the planetary hierarchy voted against the proposal, since
  they considered that far too few people had attained the necessary stage of mental
  development for the undertaking to have any prospect of success. The emotional illusions
  of the prevailing religions and the mental fictions of philosophy were so remote from the
  real conception of reality that any attempt to communicate superphysical knowledge to the
  so-called educated, either would be rejected out of hand, or would give rise to new
  imaginative excesses. They considered that one ought to wait until at least those furthest
  developed had acquired physical etheric objective consciousness. Then they would see the
  fictitiousness of the prevailing idiologies and prove readier to examine, at least, the
  reality content of the esoteric mental system.<br>
  &quot;As unanimity could not be reached, the matter was referred to the president of the
  government, the planetary ruler, who considered: &quot;as these two brothers of ours have
  offered to prepare the spread of the knowledge and have expressed their willingness
  themselves to bear the consequences and know what this means, they should be allowed to
  make the attempt.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The time for the publication of the knowledge was fixed for 1875. In the meantime
  everything was to be done to raise the general level of education and to spread
  literacy.&quot; K 3.1.4ff</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ESOTERIC HISTORY AFTER 1875 The instrument the planetary hierarchy had
  chosen for the task of publicizing the knowledge which had been kept secret since Atlantis
  was H. P. Blavatsky (1831-1891). &quot;Blavatsky was enjoined not to give out any esoteric
  facts without special permission in each individual case. She was not to mention anything
  about the planetary hierarchy.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The truth, or the knowledge of reality, is only to be given gradually, with sparing
  facts, to a mankind unprepared to receive it. It is necessary to find connections to
  established fictions of which people have heard enough for them to believe that they
  comprehend what it all is about. A new, revolutionary system of ideas would be rejected
  off hand as a mere fantastic invention. It could not be comprehended, let alone
  understood, without careful preparation.<br>
  &quot;The most important reason, which probably only esotericians are able to understand,
  is the fact of the dynamic energy of ideas.&quot; <br>
  &quot;Once the esoteric knowledge was permitted to be published there was no longer any
  need of initiation into the old knowledge orders, nobody having been initiated into anyone
  of them since 1875. Although those initiated in previous incarnations were not given the
  opportunity to revive all their old knowledge, enough was made known, and besides hinted
  at, for them to be able to discover the most essential by themselves.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The most important esoteric facts to be found in the works of Sinnett, Judge, and
  Hartmann &#150; who received them from the planetary hierarchy through Blavatsky up to
  1891 &#150; are: reincarnation, karma, or the law of sowing and reaping (the law of
  reaping), the individual&#146;s pre-existence and post-existence (hence immortality), the
  existence of the worlds 45&#150;49, knowledge of the individual&#146;s envelopes in higher
  worlds, knowledge orders in times past, and lots of historical facts.&quot; K 3.2.1ff<br>
  Blavatsky was a causal self. In 1875 she contributed to the founding of the Theosophical
  Society, which was intended to become a platform for the esoteric teaching. In 1877
  Blavatsky published <i>Isis Unveiled</i>, which in two volumes criticized the dogmas of
  science and religion.<i> </i><br>
  &quot;Blavatsky&#146;s second standard work of her vast literary production, The Secret
  Doctrine... contains the symbols of &#145;Dzyan&#146; (the oldest of the planetary
  hierarchy). It gives an account of the different symbolic presentations of the cosmos and
  of the evolution of life as by several knowledge orders, showing how these agree.&quot; K
  3.3.28ff<br>
  &quot;With the death of Blavatsky in 1891, this first phase of the publication of new
  esoteric facts ended.&quot; &quot;The second phase, which lasted 1894-1920, was
  characterized by the close collaboration of two esoteric capacities: Annie Besant
  (1847-1933) and C.W. Leadbeater (1847-1934).&quot; Both were causal selves.<br>
  Leadbeater &quot;was the foremost systematician and historian of esoterics up to 1920...
  Nobody before him has given so many new facts.&quot; Of these facts the following are the
  most important: &quot;the composition of matter, the difference between atomic and
  molecular matter, the seven atomic worlds of the solar system, the molecular worlds of the
  planetary system, involutionary matter, the evolution of the natural kingdoms, the
  consciousness expansion..., man&#146;s three atomic worlds and five molecular worlds of
  man, man&#146;s five material envelopes and consciousness in these, man&#146;s permanent
  atoms (the triad), the planetary hierarchy, the division of the planetary hierarchy into
  seven departments, the planetary government.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The third and latest phase of the publication of the esoteric knowledge falls during
  1920-1950.&quot;... &quot;The planetary hierarchy had appointed a &#145;secretary&#146;
  who was to be the actual link between the esotericians and the planetary hierarchy, and
  had decided that, for the time being at least, new facts were to be imparted only through
  him: the 45-self D.K.&quot; K 3.2.10ff<br>
  The works of D.K., published under the name of Alice A. Bailey, are fundamental importance
  for the esoteric teaching of our times. They deepen the teaching previously given,
  correcting and amplifying it in many places, and provides much knowledge. Main points in
  D.K.&#146;s presentation are: evolution in the solar system as principally a manifestation
  of the will and man as a phenomenon of will and energy within it, the seven departments
  (types) as the basis of a new psychology, the activation of man&#146;s passive causal
  consciousness as the most important feature of both &#145;white magic&#146; and the future
  system of education, the significance of Augoeides for man&#146;s evolution,
  mankind&#146;s relation to the planetary hierarchy and planetary government, discipleship
  and the initiations, the reappearance of the planetary hierarchy in the physical world
  (externalization) under the guidance of the world teacher, &#145;the new group of world
  servers&#146; which ever more consciously collaborates with the hierarchy&#146;s plan for
  the evolution of mankind. <br>
  &quot;D.K. points out that the individual has not been given the knowledge to enjoy it
  with a pleasant feeling of superiority. It entails responsibility, as does all
  knowledge.&quot; K 3.9.2<br>
  D.K. says expressly that he writes for disciples (individuals at the stage of humanity).
  His works cannot be understood without a suitable preparation. </p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HUMANIST Man at the higher mental stage, or the stage of humanity.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HUMANITY, STAGE OF The fourth of man&#146;s five stages of development.<br>
  &quot;The most distinguishing trait of the humanist is his striving after common sense, a
  prerequisite for acquiring causal intuition. He can no longer, like the mystic, lose
  himself in the ineffable, but demands above all clarity in everything and facts for
  everything. His firm determination to comprehend reality and life despite everything
  compels him always to seek further... When he has come to the Sokratean realization that
  man cannot know anything worth knowing, he is ready to receive the esoteric knowledge.<br>
  &quot;In the old days, he would then have been chosen to be initiated into some secret
  knowledge order. Nowadays he is given the knowledge in a mental system of the fundamental
  facts of existence, which his reason compels him to accept as the only tenable working
  hypothesis.&quot; K 1.34.19f</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HYLOZOICS (Gr. hyle, &#145;matter&#146;, and zoe, &#145;life&#146;)
  &#145;Spiritual materialism&#146; or the doctrine that matter is the necessary basis of
  all consciousness. The system of esoteric knowledge formulated by the then 46-self
  Pythagoras was intended to form the basis of the science of the future. In advance of
  other esoteric systems, hylozoics is characterized by the fact that it alone explains that
  existence is a trinity of matter, motion, and consciousness; it alone explains that
  consciousness is a quality of matter and so doing clears away subjectivism and
  illusionism; it alone has abstained from vague symbolism and has instead strived after
  scientific exactitude and unambiguous terminology. In order to achieve this exactitude
  hylozoics in its explanations starts from the matter aspect.<br>
  The modern formulation of hylozoics was presented by Henry T. Laurency in <i>The
  Philosopher&#146;s Stone </i>in 1950 and contains as essential elements the following
  doctrines: the self is a primordial atom (monad), all the forms of nature are envelopes
  for monads, all consciousness (also the highest cosmic consciousness) is product of an
  evolution that pervades everything in the cosmos, there are seven basic laws of life, and
  mankind (every human individual) goes through five chief stages of development. (K 1.4,

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDEALITY, STAGE OF The highest of man&#146;s five stages of
  development. At the stage of humanity, man can, in the proper sense, understand esoterics.
  At the stage of ideality, he uses the insight he has gained to activate his hitherto
  passive causal consciousness (47:2,3). So doing he can ascertain facts about reality in
  the three worlds of man (47<font FACE="Symbol">-</font> 49) and study his previous
  incarnations in the human kingdom.<br>
  &quot;As a causal self he acquires knowledge of the laws of life and the ability to make
  rational use of this knowledge with one-pointed purpose.&quot; K 1.34.22<br>
  &quot;He enters into communication with those in higher kingdoms and receives from them
  the further facts he needs but cannot ascertain for himself. He gradually acquires the
  twelve essential qualities that make it possible for him to pass to the fifth natural
  kingdom.&quot; K 1.34.23</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDEAS &quot;There are cosmic ideas, systemic ideas, planetary ideas, as
  many different kinds of ideas as there are kinds of atomic consciousness and atomic worlds
  in the cosmos.<br>
  &quot;It is our planetary government that is entrusted with the cosmic ideas pertaining to
  the maintenance and development of the life in the planet and which also sees to it that
  they are realized in accordance with the laws.<br>
  &quot;These ideas are the causes of the processes in nature, the causes of the formation,
  changes, and dissolution of matter, and they are the preconditions of the consciousness
  development of all the natural kingdoms.&quot; K 2.16.2ff</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDEAS, DYNAMIC ENERGY OF &quot;Every idea is a mental atom charged with
  energy. If these succeed in penetrating into brain-cells that are receptive, yet not
  previously vitalized by similar mental molecules, they can have an adverse effect on the
  balance of people&#146;s minds. Imparting a whole system could cause mental chaos. The
  fact that people will instinctively fend off too revolutionary ideas is often a natural
  measure of self-protection.&quot; K 3.2.3</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDEAS, SCALING DOWN OF &quot;When the causal ideas of intuition are
  mentalized into mental concepts, these ideas become ideals for reason, and when these
  ideals are emotionalized, they become dogmas for emotional thinking. But when the ideas
  have thus been twice scaled down, their relative validity has been made absolute and thus
  they have become inimical to life.&quot; K 5.8.19</p>

  &quot;The ideas of the world of ideas are objective forms as well as being subjective, and
  thus the ideas are faithful representations of enduring objective and subjective
  realities. Every intuition corresponds to a mental system of reality ideas. Lower worlds
  exist in the ideas of the world of ideas and thus the knowledge of these lower worlds is
  contained in the idea systems of the intuitions. &#145;Beholding the ideas in the world of
  ideas&#146; meant experiencing the reality content, with all its relationships, of the
  knowledge system inherent in the causal idea.<br>
  &quot;The world of ideas is, among many other things, the unadulterated memory of all past
  events in the physical, emotional, and mental worlds ever since the planet came into
  being. The subjective consciousness content of these ideas gives us exact knowledge of
  reality without possibility of mistake, fictionalism, or deception. They also constitute
  our ideals, since they explain the ends and the ways of their realization. The forms in
  the world of ideas are the perfect forms of beauty.&quot; K 5.8.17f<br>
  &quot;Platon&#146;s ideas are living forces, causal elementals with ideas charged with
  energy.&quot; K 5.33.7 </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDENTIFICATION &quot;Since man tends always to identify his self (his
  monad, ultimate self) with that envelope in which he happens for the time to be, he
  regards himself in the physical world as being a physical self, in the emotional world as
  an emotional self, in the mental world as a mental self, and in the causal world as a
  causal self <font FACE="Symbol">-</font> not seeing that he is a monad, an ultimate
  self.&quot; K&nbsp;1.14.7<br>
  &quot;When the monad has gone through involution and evolution of the process of
  manifestation, acquired and discarded envelope after envelope in world after world, and,
  finally, in the highest cosmic world, has freed itself from its involvation into matter,
  it becomes conscious of itself as a monad. Until then it will identify itself with one or

  common apprehension that is universally valid until in the highest cosmic world.&quot; K

  &quot;Consciousness cannot exist without a material basis. The importance of the
  consciousness aspect increases with each higher material world and the importance of the
  matter aspect decreases. But it is a mistake to deny the absolute existence of the matter
  aspect and an even greater one to disregard its significance in the worlds of man. The

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER &quot;It is important for scientists of all kinds
  to understand that everything has an individual character. Every primordial atom (monad)

  Every change (because of continual exchange of atoms in the aggregate) is unique.&quot; K

  under the guidance of his teacher (a member of a higher natural kingdom) breaks through to

  conquers it. The condition of this is the self-acquisition of all the necessary qualities
  and abilities up to initiation. The first initiation concerns atomic kind 49; the second,
  48; the third, 47; the fourth, 46; the fifth, 45; the sixth, 44; the seventh 43; the
  eighth, 42; and the ninth, 36. This is the general principle. In actual fact, the three
  lowest kinds of atomic consciousness are only acquired in connection with the fourth
  initiation. Therefore, the first three initiations concern consciousness in 49:2, 48:2,

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">INNER ROUND (T.B.) The activity of life within a seven-globe is
  concentrated almost entirely to one of the seven globes in turn. However, there are in the
  six other globes small nuclei of monads belonging to all the natural kingdoms, monads who
  in the evolution have either lagged behind or overtaken the main body. These separate

  mental world and succeeded in the conquest of the consciousness of intuition. Even most
  philosophers are still in the two lowest domains of deductive thinking and principle

  &quot;In the main, there are three totally different kinds of so-called theory of

  hylozoics, respectively. <br>
  &quot;The Western theory is either the usual agnostic or skeptical physicalism that denies
  the existence of anything that cannot be ascertained by everybody, and regards
  consciousness as a quality of organic matter; or philosophic subjectivism that attributes
  man's different kinds of consciousness to a fictitious &quot;immaterial&quot; or
  &quot;spiritual&quot; world of consciousness. <br>
  &quot;The advaita philosophy makes the cardinal mistake of judging reality in one world
  from the apprehension of reality in another world, and therefore arrives at nothing but
  absurdities. The apprehension of reality in world 45, for example, is logically impossible
  to both 47- selves and 43-selves. The philosophers must learn to let &#145;this be
  this&#146; in every world. K 7.2.11ff<br>
  &quot;Hylozoics maintains that every world is its own inevitable reality, just as real as

  the seat of the power to think. In the human kingdom, the mental envelope is activated
  through the emotional envelope, which has the result that the two envelopes are woven
  together and form one envelope, which explains why the normal individual has such
  difficulty in thinking independently of emotion.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MENTAL LIBERATION FROM EMOTIONALITY &quot;During incarnation the
  emotional and mental envelopes coalesce so as to form, as it were, one single envelope

  completely dominates the mental. A prerequisite of liberating the mental from the
  dependence on the emotional is that the coalescence be discontinued. This also results in
  mental objective consciousness. The method will remain esoteric until mankind has become
  humanized. Until then, the lowest mental (47:7) can at best dominate the two lowest
  emotional ones (48:6,7) and the two lowest mental ones (47:6,7) the four lower emotional
  (48:4-7).&quot; K 6.8.8 <br>
  From this it follows that only 47:5, perspective thinking, can control the higher

  Quasi-occultism is a phenomenon at the emotional stage (the stages of civilization and

  possesses sufficient common sense to see through the attractive illusions of prospects of
  absurdly rapid &#145;spiritual&#146; development which are part and parcel of the typical
  offers of the quasi-occult movements. If, in addition, he has come in contact with
  esoterics, he immediately realizes that it is incomparably superior as an explanation.
  This power of discrimination does not exist at the emotional stage (including the levels
  of the mystic).<br>
  It is important to understand that quasi-occult teachings do not primarily satisfy
  man&#146;s mental needs (knowledge) but his emotional ones (comfort). At a transitional
  stage, they may be of great therapeutic value, help people to overcome repulsive
  emotionality. Therefore, the esoterician wishes neither to oppose those movements nor to

  &quot;Since the conception of right comes from the life view, which in its turn is based

  With each higher kingdom the consciousness aspect grows more and more in significance, so
  greatly that the matter aspect (which of course always remains the basis that can never be
  lost) comes to seem utterly insignificant. But since with each higher kind of atomic

  &quot;Time lacks dimension. Using a line to symbolize time was a failure, a thoroughly
  badly chosen simile which has given raise to many misconceptions. Only space has
  dimension. Time is that unity which links the past to the present and the future. Time is
  durability, continued existence, duration. Objective time is always connected with space
  in a succession of events. It is a measure of processes and therefore can be divided into
  periods, or time-cycles. Time is both objective and subjective. The cosmos (in primordial
  matter) consists of manifestational matter and is that which we can term space in which
  all worlds exist. Time is a way of measuring the total process in which all events occur.
  Space as well as time can be divided into units however small and, for us, are ways of
  measuring and grading.&quot;<br>

  Evolution in the solar system (43-49) is evolution in and through triads. The monad
  activates its triads from below. It is always involved in the physical atom of the first
  triad. In the animal kingdom, the monad passes to the emotional atom, and in the human
  kingdom (at the mental stage) to the mental molecule. The transition to the fifth natural
  kingdom implies a transition to second triad mental atom, whereupon the first triad can be
  dispensed with. The transition to the sixth natural kingdom implies a transition to the
  third triad 45-atom, whereupon the second triad is dispensed with as well. As long as the
