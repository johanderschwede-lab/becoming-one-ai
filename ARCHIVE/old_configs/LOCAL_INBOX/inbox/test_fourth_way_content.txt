# Fourth Way Teaching Example

**From Johan**: I've been observing my automatic reactions today, and I notice how my thinking center tries to solve everything intellectually, while my feeling center gets overwhelmed by the emotional charge. When I remember myself in the middle of these patterns, there's a moment where I can see the chief feature - this need to have everything figured out - defending itself.

The real work seems to be in that moment of self-remembering, when I can see the false personality pattern without being identified with it. It's exactly like what we teach about turning 180 degrees toward the feeling instead of away from it.

**Participant Question**: How do you know when you're in self-remembering versus just thinking about self-remembering?

**From Marianne**: That's such an important distinction. When you're truly self-remembering, there's a quality of presence that includes your body, your emotions, and your thoughts simultaneously. It's not analytical - it's more like a gentle witnessing. You can feel it in your body as a kind of openness or spaciousness.

**From Johan**: Yes, and it connects directly to our anchor work. The anchors keep us in what Gurdjieff called "waking sleep" - we think we're conscious, but we're really just running automatic programs. When we burn an anchor, we're essentially doing the work of conscious suffering - facing what we normally avoid.
