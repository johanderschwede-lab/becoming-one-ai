      ## System Architecture


      This document outlines the technical implementation of our core systems.


      ### Components

      1. Database Layer

      - Supabase for structured data

      - Pinecone for vector storage

      - Redis for caching


      2. API Integration

      - FastAPI backend

      - RESTful endpoints

      - WebSocket support


      3. Deployment

      - Railway for hosting

      - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

      - Docker containers


      ## Implementation Details

      - Use async/await patterns

      - Implement proper error handling

      - Follow SOLID principles

      - Maintain test coverage'
